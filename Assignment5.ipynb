            "sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened elliot of kellynch hall walter elliot born march 1 1760 married july 15 1784 elizabeth daughter of james stevenson esq of south park in the county of gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue elizabeth born june 1 1785 anne born august 9 1787 a still born son november 5 1789 mary born november 20 1791 precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer s hands but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of himself and his family these words after the date of mary s birth married december 16 1810 charles son and heir of charles musgrove esq of uppercross in the county of somerset and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff representing a borough in three successive parliaments exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with the arms and motto principal seat kellynch hall in the county of somerset and sir walter s handwriting again in this finale heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson of the second sir walter vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot s character vanity of person and of situation he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at fifty four was still a very fine man few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own lady elliot had been an excellent woman sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwards she had humoured or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot s death and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower the other a widow that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman _does_ marry again than when she does _not _ but sir walter s continuing in singleness requires explanation be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing which he had not been very much tempted to do elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of her mother s rights and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together most happily his two other children were of very inferior value mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way she was only anne to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued god daughter favourite and friend lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore _given_ all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow s foot about lady russell s temples had long been a distress to him elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot s death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the chapter ii mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter would rather have the _disagreeable_ prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it much serious consideration she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour but she was as desirous of saving sir walter s feelings as solicitous for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them herself the widow of only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations and she did what nobody else thought of doing she consulted anne who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter every emendation of anne s had been on the side of honesty against importance she wanted more vigorous measures a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell looking over her paper much may be done if he will adopt these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families have done or ought to do there will be nothing singular in his case and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering as it always does of our conduct i have great hope of prevailing we must be serious and decided for after all the person who has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father there is still more due to the character of an honest man this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding his friends to be urging him she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty she rated lady russell s influence highly and as to the severe degree of self denial which her own conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete than to half a reformation her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on through the whole list of lady russell s too gentle reductions how anne s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence lady russell s had no success at all could not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort of life knocked off journeys london servants horses table contractions and restrictions every where to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms quit kellynch hall the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter s retrenching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go was settled and the first outline of this important change made out there had been three alternatives london bath or another house in the country all anne s wishes had been for the latter a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russell s society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her ambition but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her and bath was to be her home sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell s spending some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne s known wishes it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter s feelings they must have been dreadful and with regard to anne s dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there after her mother s death and secondly from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must suit them all and as to her young friend s health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good anne had been too little from home too little seen her spirits were not high a larger society would improve them she wanted her to be more known the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning he was not only to quit his home but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude which stronger heads than sir walter s have found too much kellynch hall was to be let this however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house mr shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour that he would let it at all how quick come the reasons for approving what we like lady russell had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an unprosperous marriage to her father s house with the additional burden of two children she was a clever young woman who understood the art of pleasing the art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility from situation mrs clay was in lady russell s estimate a very unequal and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliot s reach was therefore an object of first rate importance chapter iii i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper that the present juncture is much in our favour this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore they will be all wanting a home could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants many a noble fortune has been made during the war if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying sir walter only nodded but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed sarcastically there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune said mrs clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clay s health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him here anne spoke the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow very true very true what miss anne says is very true was mr shepherd s rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughter s but sir walter s remark was soon afterwards the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds of objection to it first as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a man s youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man i have observed it all my life a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line one day last spring in town i was in company with two men striking instances of what i am talking of lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable looking personage you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top in the name of heaven who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near sir basil morley old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin what do you take his age to be sixty said i or perhaps sixty two forty replied sir basil forty and no more picture to yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin s age nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only _their_ lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter s good will towards a naval officer as tenant had been gifted with foresight for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him that accidentally hearing it was just as he had foretold mr shepherd observed sir walter s concerns could not be kept a secret accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let and understanding his mr shepherd s connection with the owner he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant and who is admiral croft was sir walter s cold suspicious inquiry mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman s family and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed added he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale hearty well looking man a little weather beaten to be sure but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a ready furnished house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral s family which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant he was a married man and without children the very state to be wished for a house was never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady as where there were many children a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture in the world he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be continued he asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not hear the appeal i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer s man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed after waiting another moment you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne mr shepherd was all gratitude wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term _gentleman_ i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter s estimate of the dues of a tenant it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing in the admiral s situation in life which was just high enough and not too high i have let my house to admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere _mr _ a _mr _ save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of explanation an admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said with a gentle sigh a few months more and _he_ perhaps may be walking here chapter iv _he_ was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire in the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkford he was at that time a remarkably fine young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste and feeling half the sum of attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in having them accepted a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one troubles soon arose sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away which she grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious youth killing dependence it must not be if by any fair interference of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother s love and mother s rights it would be prevented captain wentworth had no fortune he had been lucky in his profession but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing but he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still such confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil it only added a dangerous character to himself he was brilliant he was headstrong lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror she deprecated the connexion in every light such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat young and gentle as she was it might yet have been possible to withstand her father s ill will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it but it was not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it had she not imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up the belief of being prudent and self denying principally for _his_ advantage was her chief consolation under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment he had left the country in consequence a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance but not with a few months ended anne s share of suffering from it her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory no second attachment the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society around them she had been solicited when about two and twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir walter s and of good character and appearance and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father s house and settled so permanently near herself but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne s being tempted by some man of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits they knew not each other s opinion either its constancy or its change on the one leading point of anne s conduct for the subject was never alluded to but anne at seven and twenty thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen she did not blame lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs without reference to the actual results of their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ and all that he had told her would follow had taken place he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy she had no reason to believe him married how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful confidence in futurity against that over anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence she had been forced into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning with all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworth s sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil she was assisted however by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell s motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft s really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his the brother only with whom he had been residing had received any information of their short lived engagement that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature s having heard of it from him the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness chapter v on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft s seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell s and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided the whole business at once each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality on the admiral s side as could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherd s assurances of his being known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right and mr shepherd s clerks were set to work without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the best looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be no harm in him reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country did not think that everything considered she wished to remain it would be most right and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others something occurred however to give her a different duty mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing that she should not have a day s health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath i cannot possibly do without anne was mary s reasoning and elizabeth s reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay this invitation of mary s removed all lady russell s difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs clay s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne in mrs clay s being of so much use while anne could be of none was a very sore aggravation anne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her father s character she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind mrs clay had freckles and a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young and certainly altogether well looking and possessed in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister she had little hope of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning she spoke and seemed only to offend elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each party s perfectly knowing their situation mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of hers and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clay s freckles there is hardly any personal defect replied anne which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good elizabeth though resenting the suspicion might yet be made observant by it the last office of the four carriage horses was to draw sir walter miss elliot and mrs clay to bath the party drove off in very good spirits sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves and anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where she was to spend the first week her friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt this break up of the family exceedingly their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage of lady russell s journey uppercross was a moderate sized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees substantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage enclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a pear tree trained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire it had received the improvement of a farm house elevated into a cottage for his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch the traveller s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on here anne had often been staying she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each other s house at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course though better endowed than the elder sister mary had not anne s understanding nor temper while well and happy and properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits but any indisposition sunk her completely she had no resources for solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot self importance was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill used in person she was inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached the dignity of being a fine girl she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing room the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers and two children and on anne s appearing greeted her with so you are come at last i began to think i should never see you i am so ill i can hardly speak i have not seen a creature the whole morning i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell so lady russell would not get out i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband oh charles is out shooting i have not seen him since seven o clock he would go though i told him how ill i was he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning you have had your little boys with you yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good little charles does not mind a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully you know i always cure you when i come how are your neighbours at the great house i can give you no account of them i have not seen one of them to day except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out of their way you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone it is early i never want them i assure you they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner dear me what can _you_ possibly have to do a great many things i assure you more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father s books and pictures i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth s plants are for lady russell i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave i was told that they wished it but all these things took up a great deal of time oh well and after a moment s pause but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one s own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa and i think it very likely that my illness to day may be owing to it a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on anne s side produced nearly a cure on mary s she could soon sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner time then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough to propose a little walk where shall we go said she when they were ready i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible they ought to feel what is due to you as _my_ sister however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have that over we can enjoy our walk anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it to the great house accordingly they went to sit the full half hour in the old fashioned square parlour with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano forte and a harp flower stands and little tables placed in every direction oh could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration perhaps of improvement the father and mother were in the old english style and the young people in the new mr and mrs musgrove were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable not much educated and not at all elegant their children had more modern minds and manners there was a numerous family but the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant they were of consequence at home and favourites abroad anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together that good humoured mutual affection of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters they were received with great cordiality nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family which was generally as anne very well knew the least to blame the half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both the miss musgroves at mary s particular invitation chapter vi anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove so miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath do you think they will settle in and this without much waiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of i hope _we_ shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa if we do go we must be in a good situation none of your queen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary of upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away to be happy at bath she could only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell the mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy their own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping neighbours dress dancing and music she acknowledged it to be very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible she had no dread of these two months mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort she was always on friendly terms with her brother in law and in the children who loved her nearly as well and respected her a great deal more than their mother she had an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion charles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits as it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise trifled away without benefit from books or anything else he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by his wife s occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to anne s admiration and upon the whole though there was very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass for a happy couple they were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made he always contended for his father s having many other uses for his money and a right to spend it as he liked as to the management of their children his theory was much better than his wife s and his practice not so bad i could manage them very well if it were not for mary s interference was what anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in but when listening in turn to mary s reproach of charles spoils the children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had the smallest temptation to say very true one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house known to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested or at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill was charles s language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think there was anything the matter with me i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very ill a great deal worse than i ever own mary s declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with anne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing mrs charles had a little of your method with those children they are quite different creatures with you but to be sure in general they are so spoilt it is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen poor little dears without partiality but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated bless me how troublesome they are sometimes i assure you miss anne it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as i otherwise should i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment don t do this and don t do that or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them she had this communication moreover from mary mrs musgrove thinks all her servants so steady that it would be high treason to call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper house maid and laundry maid instead of being in their business are gadding about the village all day long i meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them if jemima were not the trustiest steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them and on mrs musgrove s side it was i make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter in law s concerns for i know it would not do but i shall tell _you_ miss anne because you may be able to set things to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles s nursery maid i hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from my own knowledge i can declare she is such a fine dressing lady that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid of mentioning it again it was mary s complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined at the great house with other families and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said i have no scruple of observing to _you_ how nonsensical some persons are about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world but i know it is taken notice of by many persons how was anne to set all these matters to rights she could do little more than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister s benefit in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well her own spirits improved by change of place and subject by being removed three miles from kellynch mary s ailments lessened by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse with the other family since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it was rather an advantage it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible for they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs musgrove s respectable forms in the usual places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others as she was well aware she knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation excepting one short period of her life she had never since the age of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world and mr and mrs musgrove s fond partiality for their own daughters performance and total indifference to any other person s gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification for her own the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company the neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited by everybody and had more dinner parties and more callers more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family they were more completely popular the girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally in an unpremeditated little ball there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures they would come at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else and often drew this compliment well done miss anne very well done indeed lord bless me how those little fingers of yours fly about so passed the first three weeks michaelmas came and now anne s heart must be in kellynch again a beloved home made over to others all the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects beginning to own other eyes and other limbs she could not think of much else on the 29th of september and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this the day the crofts were to come to kellynch i am glad i did not think of it before how low it makes me the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were to be visited mary deplored the necessity for herself nobody knew how much she should suffer she should put it off as long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated comfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going she wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned they came the master of the house was not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary and made himself very agreeable by his good humoured notice of her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice or in the turn of sentiment and expression mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness uprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face though her reddened and weather beaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight and thirty her manners were open easy and decided like one who had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of hing or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question she could not however reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for when the youngest miss musgrove walked in that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves was the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the piano forte i will tell you why she is out of spirits when the crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into mamma s head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard s captain at one time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved seldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thick headed unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name living or dead he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board captain frederick wentworth s frigate the laconia and from the laconia he had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters all the rest had been mere applications for money in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed and the re perusal of these letters after so long an interval her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death mr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first of being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it _might_ that it probably _would_ turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from clifton a very fine young man but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to anne s nerves she found however that it was one to which she must inure herself since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself to be insensible on such points and not only did it appear that he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect for his character stamped as it was by poor dick s having been six months under his care and mentioning him in strong though not perfectly well spelt praise as a fine dashing felow only two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as they could hear of his arrival the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening chapter vii a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross by the end of another week it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars but a week must pass only a week in anne s reckoning and then she supposed they must meet and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove s civility and she was all but calling there in the same half hour she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boy s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall the child s situation put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account his collar bone was found to be dislocated and such injury received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants her brother s return was the first comfort he could take best care of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now the collar bone was soon replaced and though mr robinson felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew s state as to give the information of captain wentworth s visit staying five minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all a favourite before how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow actually on the morrow and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought and in short he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came with their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give him the meeting oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen the child had a good night and was going on well the next day it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm and charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity for longer confinement the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him who could be of no use at home to shut himself up his father very much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house nothing can be going on better than the child said he so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain mary knew from charles s manner of speaking that he was quite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him she said nothing therefore till he was out of the room but as soon as there was only anne to hear so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all equal to it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mother s property her own feelings generally make it so i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves for the sort of thing but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening dear me that s a very good thought very good indeed to be sure i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home am i and it only harasses me you who have not a mother s feelings are a great deal the properest person you can make little charles do anything he always minds you at a word it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima oh i shall certainly go i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know you do not mind being left alone an excellent thought of yours indeed anne i will go and tell charles and get ready directly you can send for us you know at a moment s notice if anything is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child the next moment she was tapping at her husband s dressing room door and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for the whole conversation which began with mary s saying in a tone of great exultation i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him it is anne s own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday this is very kind of anne was her husband s answer and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits they were gone she hoped to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort as were perhaps ever likely to be hers she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself agreeable to others she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances he must be either indifferent or unwilling had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance and their visit in general there had been music singing talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all to know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being in mrs charles musgrove s way on account of the child and therefore somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles s being to meet him to breakfast at his father s anne understood it he wished to avoid seeing her he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps by the same view of escaping h her breakfast as she could it is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude the worst is over mary talked but she could not attend she had seen him they had met they had been once more in the same room soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness what might not eight years do events of every description changes alienations removals all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past how natural how certain too it included nearly a third part of her own life alas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing now how were his sentiments to be read was this like wishing to avoid her and the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense for after the miss musgroves had returned and hed their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive to me henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister s in a common way but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound altered beyond his knowledge anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for he was not altered or not for the worse she had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her as he would no the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages she had seen the same frederick wentworth so altered that he should not have known her again these were words which could not but dwell with her yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them they were of sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would be carried round to her he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal had spoken as he felt he had not forgiven anne elliot she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure she had given him up to oblige others it had been the effect of over persuasion it had been weakness and timidity he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again her power with him was gone for ever it was now his object to marry he was rich and being turned on shore fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow he had a heart for either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way excepting anne elliot this was his only secret exception when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy and i am a lost man should not this be enough for a sailor who has had no society among women to make him nice he said it she knew to be contradicted his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with a strong mind with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description that is the woman i want said he something a little inferior i shall of course put up with but it must not be much if i am a fool i shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject more than most men chapter viii from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the same circle they were soon dining in company together at mr musgrove s for the little boy s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each _they_ could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement could not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth his profession qualified him his disposition lead him to talk and _that_ was in the year six _that_ happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself there must be the same immediate association of thought though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain they had no conversation together no intercourse but what the commonest civility required once so much to each other now nothing there _had_ been a time when of all the large party now filling the drawing room at uppercross they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another with the exception perhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached and happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could never become acquainted it was a perpetual estrangement when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner of living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgrove s who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying ah miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son i dare say he would have been just such another by this time anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove relieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore could not keep pace with the conversation of the others when she could let her attention take its natural course again she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list their own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross and sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded your first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp you will not find her there quite worn out and broken up i was the last man who commanded her hardly fit for service then reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off to the west indies the girls looked all amazement the admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed phoo phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk never was a better sloop than the asp in her day for an old built sloop you would not see her equal lucky fellow to get her he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his i felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth seriously i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you i knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me anne s shudderings were to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to her do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case only nodded in reply and walked away the girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate and present non commissioned class observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean and i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for _us_ when you were put captain into that ship _we_ shall never forget what you did her feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth hearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more my brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking of poor richard poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth s face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove s kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too transient an indulgence of self amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent s feelings they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove it was no insignificant barrier indeed mrs musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment and while the agitations of anne s slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world but fair or not fair there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain which taste cannot tolerate which ridicule will seize the admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain wentworth and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts began with if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters should i i am glad i was not a week later then the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry he defended himself though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit which a few hours might comprehend but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort _high_ and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it this brought his sister upon him oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether nothing to the purpose replied her brother you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then all merged in my friendship sophia i would assist any brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything of harville s from the world s end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable i might not like them the better for that perhaps such a number of women and children have no _right_ to be comfortable on board my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days ah my dear said the admiral when he has got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife ay that we shall now i have done cried captain wentworth when once married people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it he got up and moved away what a great traveller you must have been ma am said mrs musgrove to mrs croft pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life and i do assure you ma am pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man of war i speak you know of the higher rates when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared thank god i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagrees with me a little disordered always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal when the admiral _captain_ croft then was in the north seas i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs croft was mrs musgrove s hearty answer there is nothing so bad as a separation i am quite of your opinion _i_ know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again the evening ended with dancing on its being proposed anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain wentworth she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference and especially the attention of all the young women could do the miss hayters the females of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who could wonder these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without consciousness _once_ she felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered features perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him and _once_ she knew that he must have spoken of her she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing she had rather play she is never tired of playing once too he spoke to her she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of unintentionally she returned to that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced to sit down again anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything chapter ix captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of the admiral s fraternal kindness as of his wife s he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off there was so much of friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfections of edward s wife upon credit a little longer it was soon uppercross with him almost every day the musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly in the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral and mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves in their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig lately added to their establishment hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth very much in the way charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth s h the interest of the story the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain benwick was now living with them entirely captain harville had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick s state of mind the sympathy and good will excited towards captain benwick was very great and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart than i have i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever he is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact younger as a man he will rally again and be happy with another they all met and were introduced captain harville was a tall dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame and from strong features and want of health looking much older than captain wentworth captain benwick looked and was the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air just as he ought to have and drew back from conversation captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging mrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly accepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to lyme without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon so unlike the usual style of give and take invitations and dinners of formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother officers these would have been all my friends was her thought and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness on quitting the cobb they all went in doors with their new friends and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many anne had a moment s astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville to turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies of lodging house furniture and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected the varieties in the fitting up of the rooms where the common necessaries provided by the owner in the common indifferent plight were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood excellently worked up and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented made it to her a something more or less than gratification captain harville was no reader but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of well bound volumes the property of captain benwick his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new netting needles and pins with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large fishing net at one corner of the room anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved they went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being so entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme and the no expectation of company had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in captain wentworth s company than she had at first imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it they never got beyond was become a mere nothing the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening and he came bringing his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers he ventured among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others it fell to anne s lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening s indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out of their conversation for though shy he did not seem reserved it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first rate poets trying to ascertain whether _marmion_ or _the lady of the lake_ were to be preferred and how ranked the _giaour_ and _the bride of abydos _ and moreover how the _giaour_ was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines which imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion to his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested to particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists such collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances captain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for the interest implied and though with a shake of the head and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure and read them when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists and preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination chapter xii anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast they went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide which a fine south easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted they praised the morning gloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the fresh feeling breeze and were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with oh yes i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the sea air always does good there can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness last spring twelvemonth he declares himself that coming to lyme for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took and that being by the sea always makes him feel young again now i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely and fix at lyme do not you anne do not you agree with me that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of his having another seizure indeed i think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out from all the world i wish his friends would propose it to him i really think they ought and as to procuring a dispensation there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions over scrupulous i must say do not you think anne it is being over scrupulous do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties which may be just as well performed by another person and at lyme too only seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was anything to complain of anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate s being married i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion i wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate with dr shirley i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything i am afraid of her as i have told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross anne was amused by henrietta s manner of being grateful and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of henrietta s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family she had only time however for a general answer and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town they were all at her disposal when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back and stopped to give them way they ascended and passed him and as they passed anne s face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced it was evident that the gentleman completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it he gave her a momentary glance a glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you and even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again after attending louisa through her business and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining room had nearly run against the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves and determined that a well looking groom who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back should be his servant both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves and this second meeting short as it was also proved again by the gentleman s looks that he thought hers very lovely and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was a man of exceedingly good manners he seemed about thirty and though not handsome had an agreeable person anne felt that she should like to know who he was they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party to the window it was a gentleman s carriage a curricle but only coming round from the stable yard to the front door somebody must be going away it was driven by a servant in mourning the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused anne s curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off ah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne it is the very man we passed the miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table the waiter came into the room soon afterwards pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london elliot many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity of a waiter bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father s next heir pray sir turning to the waiter did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day there you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes but anne only conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me oh the great coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together said captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin when she could command mary s attention anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an h his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship and regard but by the tenderness of the past yes some share of the tenderness of the past she could not contemplate the change as implying less he must love her these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him without even trying to discern him when their places were determined on and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not her eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches anne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manœuvred so well with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object of colonel wallis s gallantry was quite contented anne s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening it was just occupation enough she had feelings for the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific and patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better at least during the first act towards the close of it in the interval succeeding an italian song she explained the words of the song to mr elliot they had a concert bill between them this said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing of the matter you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english you need not say anything more of your ignorance here is complete proof i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long replied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what we are to have next turning to the bill perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family i knew you by report long before you came to bath i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately i have been acquainted with you by character many years your person your disposition accomplishments manner they were all present to me mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people is irresistible and anne was all curiosity she wondered and questioned him eagerly but in vain he delighted in being asked but he would not tell no no some time or other perhaps but not now he would mention no names now but such he could assure her had been the fact he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford captain wentworth s brother he might have been in mr elliot s company but she had not courage to ask the question the name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change such she believed were his words but scarcely had she received their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial her father and lady dalrymple were speaking a well looking man said sir walter a very well looking man a very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple more air than one often sees in bath irish i dare say no i just know his name a bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of the navy his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch before sir walter had reached this point anne s eyes had caught the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance as her eyes fell on him his seemed to be withdrawn from her it had that appearance it seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance was recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward when she could give another glance he had moved away he could not have come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in but she would rather have caught his eye mr elliot s speech too distressed her she had no longer any inclination to talk to him she wished him not so near her the first act was over now she hoped for some beneficial change and after a period of nothing saying amongst the party some of them did decide on going in quest of tea anne was one of the few who did not choose to move she remained in her seat and so did lady russell but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean whatever she might feel on lady russell s account to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity she was persuaded by lady russell s countenance that she had seen him he did not come however anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance but he never came the anxious interval wore away unproductively the others returned the room filled again benches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look in re settling themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her colonel wallis declined sitting down again and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals and a little scheming of her own anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before much more within reach of a passer by she could not do so without comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles but still she did it and not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth was again in sight she saw him not far off he saw her too yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her she felt that something must be the matter the change was indubitable the difference between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room was strikingly great why was it she thought of her father of lady russell could there have been any unpleasant glances he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain wentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over anne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance improved and he replied again with almost a smile they talked for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round it came from mr elliot he begged her pardon but she must be applied to to explain italian again miss carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung anne could not refuse but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed and when her own mistress again when able to turn and look as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell he must wish her good night he was going he should get home as fast as he could is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for and he was gone directly jealousy of mr elliot it was the only intelligible motive captain wentworth jealous of her affection could she have believed it a week ago three hours ago for a moment the gratification was exquisite but alas there were very different thoughts to succeed how was such jealousy to be quieted how was the truth to reach him how in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations would he ever learn of her real sentiments it was misery to think of mr elliot s attentions their evil was incalculable chapter xxi anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid mr elliot was almost a first object she felt a great deal of good will towards him in spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which he seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation by his own sentiments by his early prepossession it was altogether very extraordinary flattering but painful there was much to regret how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case was not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad her affection would be his for ever their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation prettier musings of high wrought love and eternal constancy could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way she was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her though it had been an appointment an account of the concert was immediately claimed and anne s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it all that she could tell she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath was well know by name to mrs smith the little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed they never miss a concert yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them i do not know i do not think they were old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her she never misses i know and you must have seen her she must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur round the orchestra of course no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about that the object only had been deficient no no you were better employed you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening i see it in your eye i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to in the intervals of the concert it was conversation anne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye yes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together a blush overspread anne s cheeks she could say nothing and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning it is really very good of you to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time anne heard nothing of this she was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend s penetration unable to imagine how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her after another short silence pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me does he know that i am in bath mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised a moment s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under she caught it instantaneously and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely but it seems worn out now it is a great while since we met i was not at all aware of this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot s good fortune no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week i am not going to marry mr elliot i should like to know why you imagine i am mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her head and exclaimed now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that s all let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much but less would hardly have been sufficient mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon in mr elliot s failure but from the perception of there being a somebody else as it was she instantly submitted and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have received the idea or from whom she could have heard it do tell me how it first came into your head it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago and has it indeed been spoken of did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history the whole history repeated anne laughing she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news mrs smith said nothing but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years i did not before he was married i suppose yes he was not married when i knew him first and were you much acquainted intimately indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man was he at all such as he appears now i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith s answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful at last i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black anne s astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manner she added my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put nay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from she checked herself just in time this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night cried anne this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character mrs smith hesitated a little here oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty but was not she a very low woman yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it this was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wells and dated from london as far back as july 1803 dear smith i have received yours your kindness almost overpowers me i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have lived three and twenty years in the world and have seen none like it at present believe me i have no need of your services being in cash again give me joy i have got rid of sir walter and miss they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer the baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again he is quite fool enough if he does however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion he is worse than last year i wish i had any name but elliot i am sick of it the name of walter i can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me with my second w again meaning for the rest of my life to be only yours truly wm elliot such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father she was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over and say thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling can you really yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis colonel wallis you are acquainted with him no it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived i know you did i know it all perfectly but indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme i happened to be at lyme well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say and she continued this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manœuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not lessening i understand replied mrs smith he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it why to be sure ma am said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little thoughtfulness it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness but mr elliot was not done with mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both in justice and compassion she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliot s marriage they had been as before always together and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance from his wife s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised by him mr elliot raised by his marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself for with all his self indulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend s probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingly had been ruined the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliot s had better not be tried but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known with a confidence in mr elliot s regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hard hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments that no flagrant open crime could have been worse she had a great deal to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend s usual state of mind there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west indies which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures and this property though not large would be enough to make her comparatively rich but there was nobody to stir in it mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims was hard to bear it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne s good offices with mr elliot she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne s feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliot s character would allow when anne s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything and while it took from her the new formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation she had seemed to recommend and praise him my dear was mrs smith s reply there was nothing else to be done i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he had been your husband my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless he was very unkind to his first wife they were wretched together but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her i was willing to hope that you must fare better anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell and under such a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had disclosed all too late it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved chapter xxii anne went home to think over all that she had heard in one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him he stood as opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed pity for him was all over but this was the only point of relief in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of them she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was a reward indeed springing from it mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done could the knowledge have been extended through her family but this was a vain idea she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her and having done her best wait the event with as much composure as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however to turn her eyes towards anne exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son oh i lay no embargo on any body s words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day to morrow i had compassion on him anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she saw insincerity in everything his attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along she was accordingly more guarded and more cool than she had been the night before he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin s vanity he found at least that it was not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too commanding claims of the others he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath the next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part of two days he was invited again to camden place the very evening of his return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them mrs clay s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded for the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliot s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk of spending the morning in rivers street very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and pretend i have read it through i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out lady russell quite bores one with her new publications you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert something so formal and _arrangé_ in her air and she sits so upright my best love of course and mine added sir walter kindest regards and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately while her father spoke there was a knock at the door who could it be anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were at the white hart so much was pretty soon understood but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into the other drawing room and regaling themselves with her admiration anne could not draw upon charles s brain for a regular history of their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta and captain harville beside their two selves he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding the scheme had received its first impulse by captain harville s wanting to come to bath on business he had begun to talk of it a week ago and by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed coming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear to be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end but then it had been taken up by his father and mother his mother had some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding clothes for herself and her sister and in short it ended in being his mother s party that everything might be comfortable and easy to captain harville and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience they had arrived late the night before mrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross anne s only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough for henrietta s wedding clothes to be talked of she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that very recently since mary s last letter to herself charles hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years and that on the strength of his present income with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question the two families had consented to the young people s wishes and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months quite as soon as louisa s and a very good living it was charles added only five and twenty miles from uppercross and in a very fine country fine part of dorsetshire in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get a special recommendation not that he will value it as he ought he observed charles is too cool about sporting that s the worst of him i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me mary does not above half like henrietta s match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to the value of the property it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne should be happy in their children s marriages they do everything to confer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long anne could not help laughing that cannot be much to your taste i know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read he is a brave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in my father s great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles s following the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none of the ill will of envy in it she would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs the visit passed off altogether in high good humour mary was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law s carriage with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they were detailed to her she had no demands on her father or sister and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing rooms elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style the reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch it was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better and then elizabeth was happy again these were her internal persuasions old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does did not even ask her own sister s family though they were here a month and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove put her quite out of her way i am sure she would rather not come she cannot feel easy with us i will ask them all for an evening that will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat they have not seen two such drawing rooms before they will be delighted to come to morrow evening it shall be a regular party small but most elegant and this satisfied elizabeth and when the invitation was given to the two present and promised for the absent mary was as completely satisfied she was particularly asked to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not have received a more gratifying attention miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning and anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her and henrietta directly her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes but anne convinced herself that a day s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn with an eagerness of good will which many associations contributed to form they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves and anne had the kindest welcome from each henrietta was exactly in that state of recently improved views of fresh formed happiness which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all and mrs musgrove s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress it was a heartiness and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more from the sad want of such blessings at home she was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance and on charles s leaving them together was listening to mrs musgrove s history of louisa and to henrietta s of herself giving opinions on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying to convince her that she was not ill used by anybody which mary well amused as she generally was in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have her moments of imagining a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected a large party in an hotel ensured a quick changing unsettled scene one five minutes brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there half an hour when their dining room spacious as it was seemed more than half filled a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with captains harville and wentworth the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had hastened him away from the concert room still governed he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand each other ere long we are not boy and girl to be captiously irritable misled by every moment s inadvertence and wantonly playing with our own happiness and yet a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company with each other under their present circumstances could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now they seemed deep in talk who is it come and tell me good heavens i recollect it is mr elliot himself no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till to morrow as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne to come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir and tried to be cool and unconcerned her distress returned however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves quite in the secret it was evident that the report concerning her had spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther do come anne cried mary come and look yourself you will be too late if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about lyme to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment anne did move quietly to the window she was just in time to ascertain that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well the visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with well mother i have done something for you that you will like i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night a n t i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play have not i done well mother mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful phoo phoo replied charles what s an evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like but i shall go to the play oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy there was no promise but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my father s heir the future representative of the family don t talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me the careless expression was life to anne who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles to herself charles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her mrs musgrove interposed we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying if it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home excepting on mary s account would not be the smallest impediment i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps she had spoken it but she trembled when it was done conscious that her words were listened to and daring not even to try to observe their effect it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife by persisting that he would go to the play to morrow if nobody else would captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire place probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a station with less bare faced design by anne you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy the evening parties of the place oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me i am no card player you were not formerly i know you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction after waiting a few moments he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling it is a period indeed eight years and a half is a period whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else should come in they were obliged to move anne talked of being perfectly ready and tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection wherewith to pity her their preparations however were stopped short alarming sounds were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give a general chill anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same the comfort the freedom the gaiety of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister how mortifying to feel that it was so her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure the sequel explained it after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves to morrow evening to meet a few friends no formal party it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had provided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and one card more decidedly for captain wentworth the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his the past was nothing the present was that captain wentworth would move about well in her drawing room the card was pointedly given and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out but not to anne she could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance she knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement for all the insolence of the past her spirits sank he held the card in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it only think of elizabeth s including everybody whispered mary very audibly i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted you see he cannot put the card out of his hand anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her the party separated the gentlemen had their own pursuits the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while anne belonged to them she was earnestly begged to return and dine and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow s party the frequent enumeration of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in bath while harassing herself with the never ending question of whether captain wentworth would come or not they were reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together she generally thought he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs clay s face as she listened it was transient cleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on sir walter she exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature oh dear very true only think miss elliot to my great surprise i met with mr elliot in bath street i was never more astonished he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard he had been prevented setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to morrow he was full of to morrow and it is very evident that i have been full of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head chapter xxiii one day only had passed since anne s conversation with mrs smith but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched by mr elliot s conduct except by its effects in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer her explanatory visit in rivers street she had promised to be with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner her faith was plighted and mr elliot s character like the sultaness scheherazade s head must live another day she could not keep her appointment punctually however the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain on her friends account and felt it very much on her own before she was able to attempt the walk when she reached the white hart and made her way to the proper apartment she found herself neither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there till they returned she had only to submit sit down be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed there was no delay no waste of time she was deep in the happiness of such misery or the misery of such happiness instantly two minutes after her entering the room captain wentworth said we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials materials were at hand on a separate table he went to it and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest daughter s engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again to talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style of open hearted communication minutiae which even with every advantage of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give could be properly interesting only to the principals mrs croft was attending with great good humour and whenever she spoke at all it was very sensibly anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self occupied to hear and so ma am all these thing considered said mrs musgrove in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual oh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her h her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement it is what i always protested against for my children it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement yes dear ma am said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can anne found an unexpected interest here she felt its application to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table captain wentworth s pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look one quick conscious look at her the two ladies continued to talk to re urge the same admitted truths and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear her mind was in confusion captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood he looked at her with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed come to me i have something to say and the unaffected easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was strongly enforced the invitation she roused herself and went to him the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer to captain wentworth s table not very near as she joined him captain harville s countenance re assumed the serious thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying a small miniature painting do you know who that is certainly captain benwick yes and you may guess who it is for but in a deep tone it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth he is writing about it now and with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon no replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe it was not in her nature she doted on him it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that for your sex and she answered the question smiling also yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature man s nature which has done the business for captain benwick no no it is not man s nature i will not allow it to be more man s nature than woman s to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the heaviest weather your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed with a faltering voice if woman s feelings were to be added to all this we shall never agree upon this question captain harville was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention to captain wentworth s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think he could have caught have you hed your letter said captain harville not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied and want for nothing no hurry for a signal at all well miss elliot lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably but let me observe that all histories are against you all stories prose and verse if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman s inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of woman s fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything but how shall we prove anything we never shall we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said ah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth s absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own with emotion oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long as if i may be allowed the expression so long as you have an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart was too full her breath too much oppressed you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand on her arm quite affectionately there is no quarrelling with you and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied their attention was called towards the others mrs croft was taking leave here frederick you and i part company i believe said she i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party turning to anne we had your sister s card yesterday and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either could not or would not answer fully yes said he very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute mrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter with great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried agitated air which shewed impatience to be gone anne knew not how to understand it she had the kindest good morning god bless you from captain harville but from him not a word nor a look he had passed out of the room without a look she had only time however to move closer to the table where he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning the door opened it was himself he begged their pardon but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it the work of an instant the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost beyond expression the letter with a direction hardly legible to miss a e was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick he had been also addressing her on the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her anything was possible anything might be defied rather than suspense mrs musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection she must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written her eyes devoured the following words i can listen no longer in silence i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach you pierce my soul i am half agony half hope tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone for ever i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlier death i have loved none but you unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been but never inconstant you alone have brought me to bath for you alone i think and plan have you not seen this can you fail to have understood my wishes i had not waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have penetrated mine i can hardly write i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me you sink your voice but i can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others too good too excellent creature you do us justice indeed you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in f w i must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither or follow your party as soon as possible a word a look will be enough to decide whether i enter your father s house this evening or never such a letter was not to be soon recovered from half an hour s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints of her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity every moment rather brought fresh agitation it was overpowering happiness and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation charles mary and henrietta all came in the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself they could then see that she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not stir without her for the world this was dreadful would they only have gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting and in desperation she said she would go home by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk but the chair would never do worse than all to lose the possibility of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him could not be borne the chair was earnestly protested against and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall in the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on finding her better at night anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word captain harville has no thought but of going do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me to be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss anne s message but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged i ll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity it could not be very lasting however even if he did not come to camden place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by captain harville another momentary vexation occurred charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her there was no preventing him this was almost cruel but she could not be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith s to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight of captain wentworth he joined them but as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked anne could command herself enough to receive that look and not repulsively the cheeks which had been pale now glowed and the movements which had hesitated were decided he walked by her side presently struck by a sudden thought charles said captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop there could not be an objection there could be only the most proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again and the other two proceeding together and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow there they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything but which had been followed by so many many years of division and estrangement there they returned again into the past more exquisitely happy perhaps in their re union than when it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed in a knowledge of each other s character truth and attachment more equal to act more justified in acting and there as they slowly paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers flirting girls nor nursery maids and children they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest all the little variations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday and to day there could scarcely be an end she had not mistaken him jealousy of mr elliot had been the retarding weight the doubt the torment that had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do in the last four and twenty hours it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks or words or actions occasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified he persisted in having loved none but her she had never been supplanted he never even believed himself to see her equal thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been constant unconsciously nay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it to be done he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been a sufferer from them her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun to understand himself at lyme he had received lessons of more than one sort the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harville s had fixed her superiority in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove the attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care for louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection which followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which louisa s could so ill bear a comparison or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self will between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind there he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun to deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way from that period his penance had become severe he had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of louisa s accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again than he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty i found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences he found too late in short that he had entangled himself and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed it determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere he would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore to his brother s meaning after a while to return to kellynch and act as circumstances might require i was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter anne smiled and let it pass it was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach it is something for a woman to be assured in her eight and twentieth year that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be the result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with benwick here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said but the concert still more that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments the moment of her stepping forward in the octagon room to speak to him the moment of mr elliot s appearing and tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on with energy to see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me you should have distinguished replied anne you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit was to be added i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house could have conceived all the surprise and suspense and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation she re entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last an interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high wrought felicity and she went to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment the evening came the drawing rooms were lighted up the company assembled it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found an evening shorter glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him the wallises she had amusement in understanding them lady dalrymple and miss carteret they would soon be innoxious cousins to her she cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister with the musgroves there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville the kind hearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal and with captain wentworth some moments of communications continually occurring and always the hope of more and always the knowledge of his being there it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman s portion he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her replied as if in cool deliberation not yet but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time i trust to being in charity with her soon but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter would you in short have renewed the engagement then would i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough good god he cried you would it is not that i did not think of it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success but i was proud too proud to ask again i did not understand you i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself six years of separation and suffering might have been spared it is a sort of pain too which is new to me i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i enjoyed i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards like other great men under reverses he added with a smile i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve chapter xxiv who can be in doubt of what followed when any two young people take it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other s ultimate comfort this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind consciousness of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every opposition they might in fact have borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned captain wentworth with five and twenty thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him was no longer nobody he was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which providence had placed him and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from thinking it a bad match for her on the contrary when he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight and eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank and all this assisted by his well sounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen with a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was lady russell anne knew that lady russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with and do justice to captain wentworth this however was what lady russell had now to do she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each that because captain wentworth s manners had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because mr elliot s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well regulated mind there was nothing less for lady russell to do than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment of character a natural penetration in short which no experience in others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend but she was a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible and well judging her first was to see anne happy she loved anne better than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance it was creditable to have a sister married and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn and as her own sister must be better than her husband s sisters it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain benwick or charles hayter she had something to suffer perhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored to the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette but she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate no headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation for a change is not very probable there she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him the news of his cousin anne s engagement burst on mr elliot most unexpectedly it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness which a son in law s rights would have given but though discomfited and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment he soon quitted bath and on mrs clay s quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established under his protection in london it was evident how double a game he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman at least mrs clay s affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed for the young man s sake the possibility of scheming longer for sir walter she has abilities however as well as affections and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers may finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of sir william it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of their deception in her they had their great cousins to be sure to resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others without being flattered and followed in turn is but a state of half enjoyment anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russell s meaning to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value there she felt her own inferiority very keenly the disproportion in their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moment s regret but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly nothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity she had but two friends in the world to add to his list lady russell and mrs smith to those however he was very well disposed to attach himself lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions he could now value from his heart while he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour and as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves and their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend secured her two she was their earliest visitor in their settled life and captain wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering her husband s property in the west indies by writing for her acting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend fully requited the services which she had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife mrs smith s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income with some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends to be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy and yet be happy her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits as her friend anne s was in the warmth of her heart anne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it in captain wentworth s affection his profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine she gloried in being a sailor s wife but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance  \n"

            "no one who had ever seen catherine morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine her situation in life the character of her father and mother her own person and disposition were all equally against her her father was a clergyman without being neglected or poor and a very respectable man though his name was richard and he had never been handsome he had a considerable independence besides two good livings and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters her mother was a woman of useful plain sense with a good temper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution she had three sons before catherine was born and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world as anybody might expect she still lived on lived to have six children more to see them growing up around her and to enjoy excellent health herself a family of ten children will be always called a fine family where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number but the morlands had little other right to the word for they were in general very plain and catherine for many years of her life as plain as any she had a thin awkward figure a sallow skin without colour dark lank hair and strong features so much for her person and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind she was fond of all boys plays and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy nursing a dormouse feeding a canary bird or watering a rose bush indeed she had no taste for a garden and if she gathered flowers at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take such were her propensities her abilities were quite as extraordinary she never could learn or understand anything before she was taught and sometimes not even then for she was often inattentive and occasionally stupid her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the beggar s petition and after all her next sister sally could say it better than she did not that catherine was always stupid by no means she learnt the fable of the hare and many friends as quickly as any girl in england her mother wished her to learn music and catherine was sure she should like it for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet so at eight years old she began she learnt a year and could not bear it and mrs morland who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste allowed her to leave off the day which dismissed the music master was one of the happiest of catherine s life her taste for drawing was not superior though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper she did what she could in that way by drawing houses and trees hens and chickens all very much like one another writing and accounts she was taught by her father french by her mother her proficiency in either was not remarkable and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could what a strange unaccountable character for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper was seldom stubborn scarcely ever quarrelsome and very kind to the little ones with few interruptions of tyranny she was moreover noisy and wild hated confinement and cleanliness and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house such was catherine morland at ten at fifteen appearances were mending she began to curl her hair and long for balls her complexion improved her features were softened by plumpness and colour her eyes gained more animation and her figure more consequence her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery and she grew clean as she grew smart she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement catherine grows quite a good looking girl she is almost pretty to day were words which caught her ears now and then and how welcome were the sounds to look _almost_ pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive mrs morland was a very good woman and wished to see her children everything they ought to be but her time was so much occupied in lying in and teaching the little ones that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves and it was not very wonderful that catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket baseball riding on horseback and running about the country at the age of fourteen to books or at least books of information for provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them provided they were all story and no reflection she had never any objection to books at all but from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives from pope she learnt to censure those who bear about the mockery of woe from gray that many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its fragrance on the desert air from thomson that it is a delightful task to teach the young idea how to shoot and from shakespeare she gained a great store of information amongst the rest that trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmation strong as proofs of holy writ that the poor beetle which we tread upon in corporal sufferance feels a pang as great as when a giant dies and that a young woman in love always looks like patience on a monument smiling at grief so far her improvement was sufficient and in many other points she came on exceedingly well for though she could not write sonnets she brought herself to read them and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte of her own composition she could listen to other people s performance with very little fatigue her greatest deficiency was in the pencil she had no notion of drawing not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover s profile that she might be detected in the design there she fell miserably short of the true heroic height at present she did not know her own poverty for she had no lover to portray she had reached the age of seventeen without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility without having inspired one real passion and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient this was strange indeed but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out there was not one lord in the neighbourhood no not even a baronet there was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door not one young man whose origin was unknown her father had no ward and the squire of the parish no children but when a young lady is to be a heroine the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way mr allen who owned the chief of the property about fullerton the village in wiltshire where the morlands lived was ordered to bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution and his lady a good humoured woman fond of miss morland and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village she must seek them abroad invited her to go with them mr and mrs morland were all compliance and catherine all happiness chapter 2 in addition to what has been already said of catherine morland s personal and mental endowments when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks residence in bath it may be stated for the reader s more certain information lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be that her heart was affectionate her disposition cheerful and open without conceit or affectation of any kind her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl her person pleasing and when in good looks pretty and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is when the hour of departure drew near the maternal anxiety of mrs morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe a thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm house must at such a moment relieve the fulness of her heart who would not think so but mrs morland knew so little of lords and baronets that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations her cautions were confined to the following points i beg catherine you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat when you come from the rooms at night and i wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend i will give you this little book on purpose sally or rather sarah for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister it is remarkable however that she neither insisted on catherine s writing by every post nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance nor a detail of every interesting conversation that bath might produce everything indeed relative to this important journey was done on the part of the morlands with a degree of moderation and composure which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life than with the refined susceptibilities the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite her father instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker or even putting an hundred pounds bank bill into her hands gave her only ten guineas and promised her more when she wanted it under these unpromising auspices the parting took place and the journey began it was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety neither robbers nor tempests befriended them nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on mrs allen s side of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn and that fortunately proved to be groundless they arrived at bath catherine was all eager delight her eyes were here there everywhere as they approached its fine and striking environs and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel she was come to be happy and she felt happy already they were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in pulteney street it is now expedient to give some description of mrs allen that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work and how she will probably contribute to reduce poor catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable whether by her imprudence vulgarity or jealousy whether by intercepting her letters ruining her character or turning her out of doors mrs allen was one of that numerous class of females whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them she had neither beauty genius accomplishment nor manner the air of a gentlewoman a great deal of quiet inactive good temper and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible intelligent man like mr allen in one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be dress was her passion she had a most harmless delight in being fine and our heroine s entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion catherine too made some purchases herself and when all these matters were arranged the important evening came which was to usher her into the upper rooms her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand her clothes put on with care and both mrs allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do with such encouragement catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd as for admiration it was always very welcome when it came but she did not depend on it mrs allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late the season was full the room crowded and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could as for mr allen he repaired directly to the card room and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves with more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protégée mrs allen made her way through the throng of men by the door as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow catherine however kept close at her side and linked her arm too firmly within her friend s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly but to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd it seemed rather to increase as they went on whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience but this was far from being the case and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room their situation was just the same they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies still they moved on something better was yet in view and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench here there was something less of crowd than below and hence miss morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her and of all the dangers of her late passage through them it was a splendid sight and she began for the first time that evening to feel herself at a ball she longed to dance but she had not an acquaintance in the room mrs allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly every now and then i wish you could dance my dear i wish you could get a partner for some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes but they were repeated so often and proved so totally ineffectual that catherine grew tired at last and would thank her no more they were not long able however to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained everybody was shortly in motion for tea and they must squeeze out like the rest catherine began to feel something of disappointment she was tired of being continually pressed against by people the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives and when at last arrived in the tea room she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join no acquaintance to claim no gentleman to assist them they saw nothing of mr allen and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation were obliged to sit down at the end of a table at which a large party were already placed without having anything to do there or anybody to speak to except each other mrs allen congratulated herself as soon as they were seated on having preserved her gown from injury it would have been very shocking to have it torn said she would not it it is such a delicate muslin for my part i have not seen anything i like so well in the whole room i assure you how uncomfortable it is whispered catherine not to have a single acquaintance here yes my dear replied mrs allen with perfect serenity it is very uncomfortable indeed what shall we do the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here we seem forcing ourselves into their party aye so we do that is very disagreeable i wish we had a large acquaintance here i wish we had _any _ it would be somebody to go to very true my dear and if we knew anybody we would join them directly the skinners were here last year i wish they were here now had not we better go away as it is here are no tea things for us you see no more there are indeed how very provoking but i think we had better sit still for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd how is my head my dear somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid no indeed it looks very nice but dear mrs allen are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people i think you _must_ know somebody i don t upon my word i wish i did i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner i should be so glad to have you dance there goes a strange looking woman what an odd gown she has got on how old fashioned it is look at the back after some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours it was thankfully accepted and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening till they were discovered and joined by mr allen when the dance was over well miss morland said he directly i hope you have had an agreeable ball very agreeable indeed she replied vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn i wish she had been able to dance said his wife i wish we could have got a partner for her i have been saying how glad i should be if the skinners were here this winter instead of last or if the parrys had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry i am so sorry she has not had a partner we shall do better another evening i hope was mr allen s consolation the company began to disperse when the dancing was over enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort and now was the time for a heroine who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening to be noticed and admired every five minutes by removing some of the crowd gave greater openings for her charms she was now seen by many young men who had not been near her before not one however started with rapturous wonder on beholding her no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room nor was she once called a divinity by anybody yet catherine was in very good looks and had the company only seen her three years before they would _now_ have thought her exceedingly handsome she _was_ looked at however and with some admiration for in her own hearing two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl such words had their due effect she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before her humble vanity was contented she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms and went to her chair in good humour with everybody and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention chapter 3 every morning now brought its regular duties shops were to be visited some new part of the town to be looked at and the pump room to be attended where they paraded up and down for an hour looking at everybody and speaking to no one the wish of a numerous acquaintance in bath was still uppermost with mrs allen and she repeated it after every fresh proof which every morning brought of her knowing nobody at all they made their appearance in the lower rooms and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine the master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman like young man as a partner his name was tilney he seemed to be about four or five and twenty was rather tall had a pleasing countenance a very intelligent and lively eye and if not quite handsome was very near it his address was good and catherine felt herself in high luck there was little leisure for speaking while they danced but when they were seated at tea she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being he talked with fluency and spirit and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested though it was hardly understood by her after chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them he suddenly addressed her with i have hitherto been very remiss madam in the proper attentions of a partner here i have not yet asked you how long you have been in bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the upper rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether i have been very negligent but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars if you are i will begin directly you need not give yourself that trouble sir no trouble i assure you madam then forming his features into a set smile and affectedly softening his voice he added with a simpering air have you been long in bath madam about a week sir replied catherine trying not to laugh really with affected astonishment why should you be surprised sir why indeed said he in his natural tone but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam never sir indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms yes sir i was there last monday have you been to the theatre yes sir i was at the play on tuesday to the concert yes sir on wednesday and are you altogether pleased with bath yes i like it very well now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again catherine turned away her head not knowing whether she might venture to laugh i see what you think of me said he gravely i shall make but a poor figure in your journal to morrow my journal yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense indeed i shall say no such thing shall i tell you what you ought to say if you please i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him _that_ madam is what i _wish_ you to say but perhaps i keep no journal perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenor of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal i have sometimes thought said catherine doubtingly whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars and what are they a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way i should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes in every power of which taste is the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes they were interrupted by mrs allen my dear catherine said she do take this pin out of my sleeve i am afraid it has torn a hole already i shall be quite sorry if it has for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard that is exactly what i should have guessed it madam said mr tilney looking at the muslin do you understand muslins sir particularly well i always buy my own cravats and am allowed to be an excellent judge and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it i gave but five shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin mrs allen was quite struck by his genius men commonly take so little notice of those things said she i can never get mr allen to know one of my gowns from another you must be a great comfort to your sister sir i hope i am madam and pray sir what do you think of miss morland s gown it is very pretty madam said he gravely examining it but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray how can you said catherine laughing be so she had almost said strange i am quite of your opinion sir replied mrs allen and so i told miss morland when she bought it but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes mr tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced catherine feared as she listened to their discourse that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others what are you thinking of so earnestly said he as they walked back to the ballroom not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory catherine coloured and said i was not thinking of anything that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me well then i will not thank you for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much they danced again and when the assembly closed parted on the lady s side at least with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance whether she thought of him so much while she drank her warm wine and water and prepared herself for bed as to dream of him when there cannot be ascertained but i hope it was no more than in a slight slumber or a morning doze at most for if it be true as a celebrated writer has maintained that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman s love is declared 1 it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her how proper mr tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered mr allen s head but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was and had been assured of mr tilney s being a clergyman and of a very respectable family in gloucestershire 1 vide a letter from mr richardson no 97 vol ii rambler chapter 4 with more than usual eagerness did catherine hasten to the pump room the next day secure within herself of seeing mr tilney there before the morning were over and ready to meet him with a smile but no smile was demanded mr tilney did not appear every creature in bath except himself was to be seen in the room at different periods of the fashionable hours crowds of people were every moment passing in and out up the steps and down people whom nobody cared about and nobody wanted to see and he only was absent what a delightful place bath is said mrs allen as they sat down near the great clock after parading the room till they were tired and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here this sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that mrs allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now but we are told to despair of nothing we would attain as unwearied diligence our point would gain and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age who was sitting by her and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes addressed her with great complaisance in these words i think madam i cannot be mistaken it is a long time since i had the pleasure of seeing you but is not your name allen this question answered as it readily was the stranger pronounced hers to be thorpe and mrs allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages and that many years ago their joy on this meeting was very great as well it might since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years compliments on good looks now passed and after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together how little they had thought of meeting in bath and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families sisters and cousins talking both together far more ready to give than to receive information and each hearing very little of what the other said mrs thorpe however had one great advantage as a talker over mrs allen in a family of children and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons and the beauty of her daughters when she related their different situations and views that john was at oxford edward at merchant taylors and william at sea and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were mrs allen had no similar information to give no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions consoling herself however with the discovery which her keen eyes soon made that the lace on mrs thorpe s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own here come my dear girls cried mrs thorpe pointing at three smart looking females who arm in arm were then moving towards her my dear mrs allen i long to introduce them they will be so delighted to see you the tallest is isabella my eldest is not she a fine young woman the others are very much admired too but i believe isabella is the handsomest the miss thorpes were introduced and miss morland who had been for a short time forgotten was introduced likewise the name seemed to strike them all and after speaking to her with great civility the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest how excessively like her brother miss morland is the very picture of him indeed cried the mother and i should have known her anywhere for his sister was repeated by them all two or three times over for a moment catherine was surprised but mrs thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with mr james morland before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college of the name of thorpe and that he had spent the last week of the christmas vacation with his family near london the whole being explained many obliging things were said by the miss thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her of being considered as already friends through the friendship of their brothers etc which catherine heard with pleasure and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command and as the first proof of amity she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest miss thorpe and take a turn with her about the room catherine was delighted with this extension of her bath acquaintance and almost forgot mr tilney while she talked to miss thorpe friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love their conversation turned upon those subjects of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies such as dress balls flirtations and quizzes miss thorpe however being four years older than miss morland and at least four years better informed had a very decided advantage in discussing such points she could compare the balls of bath with those of tunbridge its fashions with the fashions of london could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd these powers received due admiration from catherine to whom they were entirely new and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity had not the easy gaiety of miss thorpe s manners and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her softened down every feeling of awe and left nothing but tender affection their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump room but required when they all quitted it together that miss thorpe should accompany miss morland to the very door of mr allen s house and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands after learning to their mutual relief that they should see each other across the theatre at night and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning catherine then ran directly upstairs and watched miss thorpe s progress down the street from the drawing room window admired the graceful spirit of her walk the fashionable air of her figure and dress and felt grateful as well she might for the chance which had procured her such a friend mrs thorpe was a widow and not a very rich one she was a good humoured well meaning woman and a very indulgent mother her eldest daughter had great personal beauty and the younger ones by pretending to be as handsome as their sister imitating her air and dressing in the same style did very well this brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from mrs thorpe herself of her past adventures and sufferings which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth and conversations which had passed twenty years before be minutely repeated chapter 5 catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening in returning the nods and smiles of miss thorpe though they certainly claimed much of her leisure as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for mr tilney in every box which her eye could reach but she looked in vain mr tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump room she hoped to be more fortunate the next day and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning she hardly felt a doubt of it for a fine sunday in bath empties every house of its inhabitants and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is as soon as divine service was over the thorpes and allens eagerly joined each other and after staying long enough in the pump room to discover that the crowd was insupportable and that there was not a genteel face to be seen which everybody discovers every sunday throughout the season they hastened away to the crescent to breathe the fresh air of better company here catherine and isabella arm in arm again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation they talked much and with much enjoyment but again was catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner he was nowhere to be met with every search for him was equally unsuccessful in morning lounges or evening assemblies neither at the upper nor lower rooms at dressed or undressed balls was he perceivable nor among the walkers the horsemen or the curricle drivers of the morning his name was not in the pump room book and curiosity could do no more he must be gone from bath yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short this sort of mysteriousness which is always so becoming in a hero threw a fresh grace in catherine s imagination around his person and manners and increased her anxiety to know more of him from the thorpes she could learn nothing for they had been only two days in bath before they met with mrs allen it was a subject however in which she often indulged with her fair friend from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear catherine and would therefore shortly return she liked him the better for being a clergyman for she must confess herself very partial to the profession and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it perhaps catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love or the duties of friendship to know when delicate raillery was properly called for or when a confidence should be forced mrs allen was now quite happy quite satisfied with bath she had found some acquaintance had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend and as the completion of good fortune had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself her daily expressions were no longer i wish we had some acquaintance in bath they were changed into how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families as her young charge and isabella themselves could be never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of mrs thorpe in what they called conversation but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion and not often any resemblance of subject for mrs thorpe talked chiefly of her children and mrs allen of her gowns the progress of the friendship between catherine and isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves they called each other by their christian name were always arm in arm when they walked pinned up each other s train for the dance and were not to be divided in the set and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt and shut themselves up to read novels together yes novels for i will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel writers of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances to the number of which they are themselves adding joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine who if she accidentally take up a novel is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust alas if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another from whom can she expect protection and regard i cannot approve of it let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans let us not desert one another we are an injured body although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world no species of composition has been so much decried from pride ignorance or fashion our foes are almost as many as our readers and while the abilities of the nine hundredth abridger of the history of england or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of milton pope and prior with a paper from the spectator and a chapter from sterne are eulogized by a thousand pens there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist and of slighting the performances which have only genius wit and taste to recommend them i am no novel reader i seldom look into novels do not imagine that _i_ often read novels it is really very well for a novel such is the common cant and what are you reading miss oh it is only a novel replies the young lady while she lays down her book with affected indifference or momentary shame it is only cecilia or camilla or belinda or in short only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature the happiest delineation of its varieties the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language now had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the spectator instead of such a work how proudly would she have produced the book and told its name though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances unnatural characters and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living and their language too frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it chapter 6 the following conversation which took place between the two friends in the pump room one morning after an acquaintance of eight or nine days is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment and of the delicacy discretion originality of thought and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment they met by appointment and as isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend her first address naturally was my dearest creature what can have made you so late i have been waiting for you at least this age have you indeed i am very sorry for it but really i thought i was in very good time it is but just one i hope you have not been here long oh these ten ages at least i am sure i have been here this half hour but now let us go and sit down at the other end of the room and enjoy ourselves i have an hundred things to say to you in the first place i was so afraid it would rain this morning just as i wanted to set off it looked very showery and that would have thrown me into agonies do you know i saw the prettiest hat you can imagine in a shop window in milsom street just now very like yours only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green i quite longed for it but my dearest catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning have you gone on with udolpho yes i have been reading it ever since i woke and i am got to the black veil are you indeed how delightful oh i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world are not you wild to know oh yes quite what can it be but do not tell me i would not be told upon any account i know it must be a skeleton i am sure it is laurentina s skeleton oh i am delighted with the book i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world dear creature how much i am obliged to you and when you have finished udolpho we will read the italian together and i have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you have you indeed how glad i am what are they all i will read you their names directly here they are in my pocketbook castle of wolfenbach clermont mysterious warnings necromancer of the black forest midnight bell orphan of the rhine and horrid mysteries those will last us some time yes pretty well but are they all horrid are you sure they are all horrid yes quite sure for a particular friend of mine a miss andrews a sweet girl one of the sweetest creatures in the world has read every one of them i wish you knew miss andrews you would be delighted with her she is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive i think her as beautiful as an angel and i am so vexed with the men for not admiring her i scold them all amazingly about it scold them do you scold them for not admiring her yes that i do there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature my attachments are always excessively strong i told captain hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him unless he would allow miss andrews to be as beautiful as an angel the men think us incapable of real friendship you know and i am determined to show them the difference now if i were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you i should fire up in a moment but that is not at all likely for _you_ are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men oh dear cried catherine colouring how can you say so i know you very well you have so much animation which is exactly what miss andrews wants for i must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you that just after we parted yesterday i saw a young man looking at you so earnestly i am sure he is in love with you catherine coloured and disclaimed again isabella laughed it is very true upon my honour but i see how it is you are indifferent to everybody s admiration except that of one gentleman who shall be nameless nay i cannot blame you speaking more seriously your feelings are easily understood where the heart is really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else everything is so insipid so uninteresting that does not relate to the beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never see him again not see him again my dearest creature do not talk of it i am sure you would be miserable if you thought so no indeed i should not i do not pretend to say that i was not very much pleased with him but while i have udolpho to read i feel as if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must be laurentina s skeleton behind it it is so odd to me that you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects to novels no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall in our way sir charles grandison that is an amazing horrid book is it not i remember miss andrews could not get through the first volume it is not like udolpho at all but yet i think it is very entertaining do you indeed you surprise me i thought it had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head to night i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you the men take notice of _that_ sometimes you know but it does not signify if they do said catherine very innocently signify oh heavens i make it a rule never to mind what they say they are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit and make them keep their distance are they well i never observed _that_ they always behave very well to me oh they give themselves such airs they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of so much importance by the by though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man do you like them best dark or fair i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown not fair and and not very dark very well catherine that is exactly he i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown skin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste is different i prefer light eyes and as to complexion do you know i like a sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description betray you what do you mean nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop the subject catherine in some amazement complied and after remaining a few moments silent was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world laurentina s skeleton when her friend prevented her by saying for heaven s sake let us move away from this end of the room do you know there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour they really put me quite out of countenance let us go and look at the arrivals they will hardly follow us there away they walked to the book and while isabella examined the names it was catherine s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men they are not coming this way are they i hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us pray let me know if they are coming i am determined i will not look up in a few moments catherine with unaffected pleasure assured her that she need not be longer uneasy as the gentlemen had just left the pump room and which way are they gone said isabella turning hastily round one was a very good looking young man they went towards the church yard well i am amazingly glad i have got rid of them and now what say you to going to edgar s buildings with me and looking at my new hat you said you should like to see it catherine readily agreed only she added perhaps we may overtake the two young men oh never mind that if we make haste we shall pass by them presently and i am dying to show you my hat but if we only wait a few minutes there will be no danger of our seeing them at all i shall not pay them any such compliment i assure you i have no notion of treating men with such respect _that_ is the way to spoil them catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning and therefore to show the independence of miss thorpe and her resolution of humbling the sex they set off immediately as fast as they could walk in pursuit of the two young men chapter 7 half a minute conducted them through the pump yard to the archway opposite union passage but here they were stopped everybody acquainted with bath may remember the difficulties of crossing cheap street at this point it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature so unfortunately connected with the great london and oxford roads and the principal inn of the city that a day never passes in which parties of ladies however important their business whether in quest of pastry millinery or even as in the present case of young men are not detained on one side or other by carriages horsemen or carts this evil had been felt and lamented at least three times a day by isabella since her residence in bath and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more for at the very moment of coming opposite to union passage and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds and threading the gutters of that interesting alley they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself his companion and his horse oh these odious gigs said isabella looking up how i detest them but this detestation though so just was of short duration for she looked again and exclaimed delightful mr morland and my brother good heaven tis james was uttered at the same moment by catherine and on catching the young men s eyes the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches and the servant having now scampered up the gentlemen jumped out and the equipage was delivered to his care catherine by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected received her brother with the liveliest pleasure and he being of a very amiable disposition and sincerely attached to her gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction which he could have leisure to do while the bright eyes of miss thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice and to her his devoirs were speedily paid with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed catherine had she been more expert in the development of other people s feelings and less simply engrossed by her own that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself john thorpe who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses soon joined them and from him she directly received the amends which were her due for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of isabella on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow he was a stout young man of middling height who with a plain face and ungraceful form seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy he took out his watch how long do you think we have been running it from tetbury miss morland i do not know the distance her brother told her that it was twenty three miles _three_ and twenty cried thorpe five and twenty if it is an inch morland remonstrated pleaded the authority of road books innkeepers and milestones but his friend disregarded them all he had a surer test of distance i know it must be five and twenty said he by the time we have been doing it it is now half after one we drove out of the inn yard at tetbury as the town clock struck eleven and i defy any man in england to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness that makes it exactly twenty five you have lost an hour said morland it was only ten o clock when we came from tetbury ten o clock it was eleven upon my soul i counted every stroke this brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses miss morland do but look at my horse did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life the servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving off such true blood three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles look at that creature and suppose it possible if you can he _does_ look very hot to be sure hot he had not turned a hair till we came to walcot church but look at his forehand look at his loins only see how he moves that horse _cannot_ go less than ten miles an hour tie his legs and he will get on what do you think of my gig miss morland a neat one is not it well hung town built i have not had it a month it was built for a christchurch man a friend of mine a very good sort of fellow he ran it a few weeks till i believe it was convenient to have done with it i happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind though i had pretty well determined on a curricle too but i chanced to meet him on magdalen bridge as he was driving into oxford last term ah thorpe said he do you happen to want such a little thing as this it is a capital one of the kind but i am cursed tired of it oh d said i i am your man what do you ask and how much do you think he did miss morland i am sure i cannot guess at all curricle hung you see seat trunk sword case splashing board lamps silver moulding all you see complete the iron work as good as new or better he asked fifty guineas i closed with him directly threw down the money and the carriage was mine and i am sure said catherine i know so little of such things that i cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear neither one nor t other i might have got it for less i dare say but i hate haggling and poor freeman wanted cash that was very good natured of you said catherine quite pleased oh d it when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend i hate to be pitiful an inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young ladies and on finding whither they were going it was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to edgar s buildings and pay their respects to mrs thorpe james and isabella led the way and so well satisfied was the latter with her lot so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother s friend and her friend s brother so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings that though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in milsom street she was so far from seeking to attract their notice that she looked back at them only three times john thorpe kept of course with catherine and after a few minutes silence renewed the conversation about his gig you will find however miss morland it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people for i might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day jackson of oriel bid me sixty at once morland was with me at the time yes said morland who overheard this but you forget that your horse was included my horse oh d it i would not sell my horse for a hundred are you fond of an open carriage miss morland yes very i have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one but i am particularly fond of it i am glad of it i will drive you out in mine every day thank you said catherine in some distress from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer i will drive you up lansdown hill to morrow thank you but will not your horse want rest rest he has only come three and twenty miles to day all nonsense nothing ruins horses so much as rest nothing knocks them up so soon no no i shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while i am here shall you indeed said catherine very seriously that will be forty miles a day forty aye fifty for what i care well i will drive you up lansdown to morrow mind i am engaged how delightful that will be cried isabella turning round my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third a third indeed no no i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about that would be a good joke faith morland must take care of you this brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two but catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result her companion s discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met and catherine after listening and agreeing as long as she could with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self assured man especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts it was have you ever read udolpho mr thorpe udolpho oh lord not i i never read novels i have something else to do catherine humbled and ashamed was going to apologize for her question but he prevented her by saying novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since tom jones except the monk i read that t other day but as for all the others they are the stupidest things in creation i think you must like udolpho if you were to read it it is so very interesting not i faith no if i read any it shall be mrs radcliffe s her novels are amusing enough they are worth reading some fun and nature in _them_ udolpho was written by mrs radcliffe said catherine with some hesitation from the fear of mortifying him no sure was it aye i remember so it was i was thinking of that other stupid book written by that woman they make such a fuss about she who married the french emigrant i suppose you mean camilla yes that s the book such unnatural stuff an old man playing at see saw i took up the first volume once and looked it over but i soon found it would not do indeed i guessed what sort of stuff it must be before i saw it as soon as i heard she had married an emigrant i was sure i should never be able to get through it i have never read it you had no loss i assure you it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine there is nothing in the world in it but an old man s playing at see saw and learning latin upon my soul there is not this critique the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor catherine brought them to the door of mrs thorpe s lodgings and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son as they met mrs thorpe who had descried them from above in the passage ah mother how do you do said he giving her a hearty shake of the hand where did you get that quiz of a hat it makes you look like an old witch here is morland and i come to stay a few days with you so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near and this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother s heart for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection on his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness for he asked each of them how they did and observed that they both looked very ugly these manners did not please catherine but he was james s friend and isabella s brother and her judgment was further bought off by isabella s assuring her when they withdrew to see the new hat that john thought her the most charming girl in the world and by john s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening had she been older or vainer such attacks might have done little but where youth and diffidence are united it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world and of being so very early engaged as a partner and the consequence was that when the two morlands after sitting an hour with the thorpes set off to walk together to mr allen s and james as the door was closed on them said well catherine how do you like my friend thorpe instead of answering as she probably would have done had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case i do not like him at all she directly replied i like him very much he seems very agreeable he is as good natured a fellow as ever lived a little of a rattle but that will recommend him to your sex i believe and how do you like the rest of the family very very much indeed isabella particularly i am very glad to hear you say so she is just the kind of young woman i could wish to see you attached to she has so much good sense and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable i always wanted you to know her and she seems very fond of you she said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be and the praise of such a girl as miss thorpe even you catherine taking her hand with affection may be proud of indeed i am she replied i love her exceedingly and am delighted to find that you like her too you hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there because i thought i should soon see you myself i hope you will be a great deal together while you are in bath she is a most amiable girl such a superior understanding how fond all the family are of her she is evidently the general favourite and how much she must be admired in such a place as this is not she yes very much indeed i fancy mr allen thinks her the prettiest girl in bath i dare say he does and i do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than mr allen i need not ask you whether you are happy here my dear catherine with such a companion and friend as isabella thorpe it would be impossible for you to be otherwise and the allens i am sure are very kind to you yes very kind i never was so happy before and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _me_ james accepted this tribute of gratitude and qualified his conscience for accepting it too by saying with perfect sincerity indeed catherine i love you dearly inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters the situation of some the growth of the rest and other family matters now passed between them and continued with only one small digression on james s part in praise of miss thorpe till they reached pulteney street where he was welcomed with great kindness by mr and mrs allen invited by the former to dine with them and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet a pre engagement in edgar s buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other the time of the two parties uniting in the octagon room being correctly adjusted catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised restless and frightened imagination over the pages of udolpho lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner incapable of soothing mrs allen s fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity in being already engaged for the evening chapter 8 in spite of udolpho and the dressmaker however the party from pulteney street reached the upper rooms in very good time the thorpes and james morland were there only two minutes before them and isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste of admiring the set of her gown and envying the curl of her hair they followed their chaperons arm in arm into the ballroom whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection the dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated and james who had been engaged quite as long as his sister was very importunate with isabella to stand up but john was gone into the card room to speak to a friend and nothing she declared should induce her to join the set before her dear catherine could join it too i assure you said she i would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world for if i did we should certainly be separated the whole evening catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude and they continued as they were for three minutes longer when isabella who had been talking to james on the other side of her turned again to his sister and whispered my dear creature i am afraid i must leave you your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin i know you will not mind my going away and i dare say john will be back in a moment and then you may easily find me out catherine though a little disappointed had too much good nature to make any opposition and the others rising up isabella had only time to press her friend s hand and say good bye my dear love before they hurried off the younger miss thorpes being also dancing catherine was left to the mercy of mrs thorpe and mrs allen between whom she now remained she could not help being vexed at the non appearance of mr thorpe for she not only longed to be dancing but was likewise aware that as the real dignity of her situation could not be known she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner to be disgraced in the eye of the world to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity her actions all innocence and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine s life and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character catherine had fortitude too she suffered but no murmur passed her lips from this state of humiliation she was roused at the end of ten minutes to a pleasanter feeling by seeing not mr thorpe but mr tilney within three yards of the place where they sat he seemed to be moving that way but he did not see her and therefore the smile and the blush which his sudden reappearance raised in catherine passed away without sullying her heroic importance he looked as handsome and as lively as ever and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing looking young woman who leant on his arm and whom catherine immediately guessed to be his sister thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever by being married already but guided only by what was simple and probable it had never entered her head that mr tilney could be married he had not behaved he had not talked like the married men to whom she had been used he had never mentioned a wife and he had acknowledged a sister from these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister s now being by his side and therefore instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on mrs allen s bosom catherine sat erect in the perfect use of her senses and with cheeks only a little redder than usual mr tilney and his companion who continued though slowly to approach were immediately preceded by a lady an acquaintance of mrs thorpe and this lady stopping to speak to her they as belonging to her stopped likewise and catherine catching mr tilney s eye instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition she returned it with pleasure and then advancing still nearer he spoke both to her and mrs allen by whom he was very civilly acknowledged i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath he thanked her for her fears and said that he had quitted it for a week on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her well sir and i dare say you are not sorry to be back again for it is just the place for young people and indeed for everybody else too i tell mr allen when he talks of being sick of it that i am sure he should not complain for it is so very agreeable a place that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year i tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health and i hope madam that mr allen will be obliged to like the place from finding it of service to him thank you sir i have no doubt that he will a neighbour of ours dr skinner was here for his health last winter and came away quite stout that circumstance must give great encouragement yes sir and dr skinner and his family were here three months so i tell mr allen he must not be in a hurry to get away here they were interrupted by a request from mrs thorpe to mrs allen that she would move a little to accommodate mrs hughes and miss tilney with seats as they had agreed to join their party this was accordingly done mr tilney still continuing standing before them and after a few minutes consideration he asked catherine to dance with him this compliment delightful as it was produced severe mortification to the lady and in giving her denial she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it that had thorpe who joined her just afterwards been half a minute earlier he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute the very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left mr tilney of her dear isabella to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman she could see nothing they were in different sets she was separated from all her party and away from all her acquaintance one mortification succeeded another and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady from such a moralizing strain as this she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder and turning round perceived mrs hughes directly behind her attended by miss tilney and a gentleman i beg your pardon miss morland said she for this liberty but i cannot anyhow get to miss thorpe and mrs thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you mrs hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than catherine the young ladies were introduced to each other miss tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness miss morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation and mrs hughes satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge returned to her party miss tilney had a good figure a pretty face and a very agreeable countenance and her air though it had not all the decided pretension the resolute stylishness of miss thorpe s had more real elegance her manners showed good sense and good breeding they were neither shy nor affectedly open and she seemed capable of being young attractive and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence catherine interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to mr tilney was desirous of being acquainted with her and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say and had courage and leisure for saying it but the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance by informing themselves how well the other liked bath how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country whether she drew or played or sang and whether she was fond of riding on horseback the two dances were scarcely concluded before catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful isabella who in great spirits exclaimed at last i have got you my dearest creature i have been looking for you this hour what could induce you to come into this set when you knew i was in the other i have been quite wretched without you my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you i could not even see where you were so i told your brother all the time but he would not believe me do go and see for her mr morland said i but all in vain he would not stir an inch was not it so mr morland but you men are all so immoderately lazy i have been scolding him to such a degree my dear catherine you would be quite amazed you know i never stand upon ceremony with such people look at that young lady with the white beads round her head whispered catherine detaching her friend from james it is mr tilney s sister oh heavens you don t say so let me look at her this moment what a delightful girl i never saw anything half so beautiful but where is her all conquering brother is he in the room point him out to me this instant if he is i die to see him mr morland you are not to listen we are not talking about you but what is all this whispering about what is going on there now i knew how it would be you men have such restless curiosity talk of the curiosity of women indeed tis nothing but be satisfied for you are not to know anything at all of the matter and is that likely to satisfy me do you think well i declare i never knew anything like you what can it signify to you what we are talking of perhaps we are talking about you therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable in this commonplace chatter which lasted some time the original subject seemed entirely forgotten and though catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all isabella s impatient desire to see mr tilney when the orchestra struck up a fresh dance james would have led his fair partner away but she resisted i tell you mr morland she cried i would not do such a thing for all the world how can you be so teasing only conceive my dear catherine what your brother wants me to do he wants me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules it would make us the talk of the place if we were not to change partners upon my honour said james in these public assemblies it is as often done as not nonsense how can you say so but when you men have a point to carry you never stick at anything my sweet catherine do support me persuade your brother how impossible it is tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing now would not it no not at all but if you think it wrong you had much better change there cried isabella you hear what your sister says and yet you will not mind her well remember that it is not my fault if we set all the old ladies in bath in a bustle come along my dearest catherine for heaven s sake and stand by me and off they went to regain their former place john thorpe in the meanwhile had walked away and catherine ever willing to give mr tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once made her way to mrs allen and mrs thorpe as fast as she could in the hope of finding him still with them a hope which when it proved to be fruitless she felt to have been highly unreasonable well my dear said mrs thorpe impatient for praise of her son i hope you have had an agreeable partner very agreeable madam i am glad of it john has charming spirits has not he did you meet mr tilney my dear said mrs allen no where is he he was with us just now and said he was so tired of lounging about that he was resolved to go and dance so i thought perhaps he would ask you if he met with you where can he be said catherine looking round but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance ah he has got a partner i wish he had asked _you_ said mrs allen and after a short silence she added he is a very agreeable young man indeed he is mrs allen said mrs thorpe smiling complacently i must say it though i _am_ his mother that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world this inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many but it did not puzzle mrs allen for after only a moment s consideration she said in a whisper to catherine i dare say she thought i was speaking of her son catherine was disappointed and vexed she seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply when john thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said well miss morland i suppose you and i are to stand up and jig it together again oh no i am much obliged to you our two dances are over and besides i am tired and do not mean to dance any more do not you then let us walk about and quiz people come along with me and i will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room my two younger sisters and their partners i have been laughing at them this half hour again catherine excused herself and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself the rest of the evening she found very dull mr tilney was drawn away from their party at tea to attend that of his partner miss tilney though belonging to it did not sit near her and james and isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile one squeeze and one dearest catherine chapter 9 the progress of catherine s unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows it appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her while she remained in the rooms which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home this on arriving in pulteney street took the direction of extraordinary hunger and when that was appeased changed into an earnest longing to be in bed such was the extreme point of her distress for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours and from which she awoke perfectly revived in excellent spirits with fresh hopes and fresh schemes the first wish of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with miss tilney and almost her first resolution to seek her for that purpose in the pump room at noon in the pump room one so newly arrived in bath must be met with and that building she had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence and the completion of female intimacy so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited confidence that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls her plan for the morning thus settled she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of mrs allen whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such that as she never talked a great deal so she could never be entirely silent and therefore while she sat at her work if she lost her needle or broke her thread if she heard a carriage in the street or saw a speck upon her gown she must observe it aloud whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not at about half past twelve a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window and scarcely had she time to inform catherine of there being two open carriages at the door in the first only a servant her brother driving miss thorpe in the second before john thorpe came running upstairs calling out well miss morland here i am have you been waiting long we could not come before the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street how do you do mrs allen a famous ball last night was not it come miss morland be quick for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off they want to get their tumble over what do you mean said catherine where are you all going to going to why you have not forgot our engagement did not we agree together to take a drive this morning what a head you have we are going up claverton down something was said about it i remember said catherine looking at mrs allen for her opinion but really i did not expect you not expect me that s a good one and what a dust you would have made if i had not come catherine s silent appeal to her friend meanwhile was entirely thrown away for mrs allen not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else and catherine whose desire of seeing miss tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with mr thorpe as isabella was going at the same time with james was therefore obliged to speak plainer well ma am what do you say to it can you spare me for an hour or two shall i go do just as you please my dear replied mrs allen with the most placid indifference catherine took the advice and ran off to get ready in a very few minutes she reappeared having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise after thorpe had procured mrs allen s admiration of his gig and then receiving her friend s parting good wishes they both hurried downstairs my dearest creature cried isabella to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage you have been at least three hours getting ready i was afraid you were ill what a delightful ball we had last night i have a thousand things to say to you but make haste and get in for i long to be off catherine followed her orders and turned away but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to james what a sweet girl she is i quite dote on her you will not be frightened miss morland said thorpe as he handed her in if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off he will most likely give a plunge or two and perhaps take the rest for a minute but he will soon know his master he is full of spirits playful as can be but there is no vice in him catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one but it was too late to retreat and she was too young to own herself frightened so resigning herself to her fate and trusting to the animal s boasted knowledge of its owner she sat peaceably down and saw thorpe sit down by her everything being then arranged the servant who stood at the horse s head was bid in an important voice to let him go and off they went in the quietest manner imaginable without a plunge or a caper or anything like one catherine delighted at so happy an escape spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip catherine though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity and considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour by no means alarmingly fast gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind in a fine mild day of february with the consciousness of safety a silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue it was broken by thorpe s saying very abruptly old allen is as rich as a jew is not he catherine did not understand him and he repeated his question adding in explanation old allen the man you are with oh mr allen you mean yes i believe he is very rich and no children at all no not any a famous thing for his next heirs he is _your_ godfather is not he my godfather no but you are always very much with them yes very much aye that is what i meant he seems a good kind of old fellow enough and has lived very well in his time i dare say he is not gouty for nothing does he drink his bottle a day now his bottle a day no why should you think of such a thing he is a very temperate man and you could not fancy him in liquor last night lord help you you women are always thinking of men s being in liquor why you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle i am sure of _this_ that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now it would be a famous good thing for us all i cannot believe it oh lord it would be the saving of thousands there is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be our foggy climate wants help and yet i have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in oxford oxford there is no drinking at oxford now i assure you nobody drinks there you would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost now for instance it was reckoned a remarkable thing at the last party in my rooms that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head it was looked upon as something out of the common way _mine_ is famous good stuff to be sure you would not often meet with anything like it in oxford and that may account for it but this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there yes it does give a notion said catherine warmly and that is that you all drink a great deal more wine than i thought you did however i am sure james does not drink so much this declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply of which no part was very distinct except the frequent exclamations amounting almost to oaths which adorned it and catherine was left when it ended with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in oxford and the same happy conviction of her brother s comparative sobriety thorpe s ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage and she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse moved along and the ease which his paces as well as the excellence of the springs gave the motion of the carriage she followed him in all his admiration as well as she could to go before or beyond him was impossible his knowledge and her ignorance of the subject his rapidity of expression and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power she could strike out nothing new in commendation but she readily echoed whatever he chose to assert and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most complete of its kind in england his carriage the neatest his horse the best goer and himself the best coachman you do not really think mr thorpe said catherine venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided and to offer some little variation on the subject that james s gig will break down break down oh lord did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life there is not a sound piece of iron about it the wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body upon my soul you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch it is the most devilish little rickety business i ever beheld thank god we have got a better i would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds good heavens cried catherine quite frightened then pray let us turn back they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on do let us turn back mr thorpe stop and speak to my brother and tell him how very unsafe it is unsafe oh lord what is there in that they will only get a roll if it does break down and there is plenty of dirt it will be excellent falling oh curse it the carriage is safe enough if a man knows how to drive it a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out lord bless you i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to york and back again without losing a nail catherine listened with astonishment she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead her own family were plain matter of fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind her father at the utmost being contented with a pun and her mother with a proverb they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next she reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity and was more than once on the point of requesting from mr thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject but she checked herself because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous and joining to this the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve them she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe and therefore would alarm herself no longer by him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten and all the rest of his conversation or rather talk began and ended with himself and his own concerns he told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums of racing matches in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner of shooting parties in which he had killed more birds though without having one good shot than all his companions together and described to her some famous day s sport with the fox hounds in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman and in which the boldness of his riding though it had never endangered his own life for a moment had been constantly leading others into difficulties which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many little as catherine was in the habit of judging for herself and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be she could not entirely repress a doubt while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit of his being altogether completely agreeable it was a bold surmise for he was isabella s brother and she had been assured by james that his manners would recommend him to all her sex but in spite of this the extreme weariness of his company which crept over her before they had been out an hour and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in pulteney street again induced her in some small degree to resist such high authority and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure when they arrived at mrs allen s door the astonishment of isabella was hardly to be expressed on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house past three o clock it was inconceivable incredible impossible and she would neither believe her own watch nor her brother s nor the servant s she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality till morland produced his watch and ascertained the fact to have doubted a moment longer _then_ would have been equally inconceivable incredible and impossible and she could only protest over and over again that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before as catherine was called on to confirm catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please isabella but the latter was spared the misery of her friend s dissenting voice by not waiting for her answer her own feelings entirely engrossed her her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home it was ages since she had had a moment s conversation with her dearest catherine and though she had such thousands of things to say to her it appeared as if they were never to be together again so with smiles of most exquisite misery and the laughing eye of utter despondency she bade her friend adieu and went on catherine found mrs allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning and was immediately greeted with well my dear here you are a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute and i hope you have had a pleasant airing yes ma am i thank you we could not have had a nicer day so mrs thorpe said she was vastly pleased at your all going you have seen mrs thorpe then yes i went to the pump room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together she says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning it is so uncommonly scarce did you see anybody else of our acquaintance yes we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs hughes and mr and miss tilney walking with her did you indeed and did they speak to you yes we walked along the crescent together for half an hour they seem very agreeable people miss tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely mrs hughes talked to me a great deal about the family and what did she tell you of them oh a vast deal indeed she hardly talked of anything else did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from yes she did but i cannot recollect now but they are very good kind of people and very rich mrs tilney was a miss drummond and she and mrs hughes were schoolfellows and miss drummond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and five hundred to buy wedding clothes mrs hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse and are mr and mrs tilney in bath yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead at least the mother is yes i am sure mrs tilney is dead because mrs hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr drummond gave his daughter on her wedding day and that miss tilney has got now for they were put by for her when her mother died and is mr tilney my partner the only son i cannot be quite positive about that my dear i have some idea he is but however he is a very fine young man mrs hughes says and likely to do very well catherine inquired no further she had heard enough to feel that mrs allen had no real intelligence to give and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister could she have foreseen such a circumstance nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others and as it was she could only lament her ill luck and think over what she had lost till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that john thorpe himself was quite disagreeable chapter 10 the allens thorpes and morlands all met in the evening at the theatre and as catherine and isabella sat together there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them oh heavens my beloved catherine have i got you at last was her address on catherine s entering the box and sitting by her now mr morland for he was close to her on the other side i shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening so i charge you not to expect it my sweetest catherine how have you been this long age but i need not ask you for you look delightfully you really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever you mischievous creature do you want to attract everybody i assure you my brother is quite in love with you already and as for mr tilney but _that_ is a settled thing even _your_ modesty cannot doubt his attachment now his coming back to bath makes it too plain oh what would not i give to see him i really am quite wild with impatience my mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world she saw him this morning you know you must introduce him to me is he in the house now look about for heaven s sake i assure you i can hardly exist till i see him no said catherine he is not here i cannot see him anywhere oh horrid am i never to be acquainted with him how do you like my gown i think it does not look amiss the sleeves were entirely my own thought do you know i get so immoderately sick of bath your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for millions we soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place really our opinions were so exactly the same it was quite ridiculous there was not a single point in which we differed i would not have had you by for the world you are such a sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it no indeed i should not oh yes you would indeed i know you better than you know yourself you would have told us that we seemed born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception my cheeks would have been as red as your roses i would not have had you by for the world indeed you do me injustice i would not have made so improper a remark upon any account and besides i am sure it would never have entered my head isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to james catherine s resolution of endeavouring to meet miss tilney again continued in full force the next morning and till the usual moment of going to the pump room she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention but nothing of that kind occurred no visitors appeared to delay them and they all three set off in good time for the pump room where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place mr allen after drinking his glass of water joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers and the ladies walked about together noticing every new face and almost every new bonnet in the room the female part of the thorpe family attended by james morland appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour and catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend james who was now in constant attendance maintained a similar position and separating themselves from the rest of their party they walked in that manner for some time till catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which confining her entirely to her friend and brother gave her very little share in the notice of either they were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute but their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices and their vivacity attended with so much laughter that though catherine s supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other she was never able to give any from not having heard a word of the subject at length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend by the avowed necessity of speaking to miss tilney whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with mrs hughes and whom she instantly joined with a firmer determination to be acquainted than she might have had courage to command had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before miss tilney met her with great civility returned her advances with equal goodwill and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room and though in all probability not an observation was made nor an expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of times before under that roof in every bath season yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth and without personal conceit might be something uncommon how well your brother dances was an artless exclamation of catherine s towards the close of their conversation which at once surprised and amused her companion henry she replied with a smile yes he does dance very well he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr thorpe miss tilney could only bow you cannot think added catherine after a moment s silence how surprised i was to see him again i felt so sure of his being quite gone away when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he was in bath but for a couple of days he came only to engage lodgings for us _that_ never occurred to me and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone was not the young lady he danced with on monday a miss smith yes an acquaintance of mrs hughes i dare say she was very glad to dance do you think her pretty not very he never comes to the pump room i suppose yes sometimes but he has rid out this morning with my father mrs hughes now joined them and asked miss tilney if she was ready to go i hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon said catherine shall you be at the cotillion ball to morrow perhaps we yes i think we certainly shall i am glad of it for we shall all be there this civility was duly returned and they parted on miss tilney s side with some knowledge of her new acquaintance s feelings and on catherine s without the smallest consciousness of having explained them she went home very happy the morning had answered all her hopes and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation the future good what gown and what head dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern she cannot be justified in it dress is at all times a frivolous distinction and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim catherine knew all this very well her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the christmas before and yet she lay awake ten minutes on wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening this would have been an error in judgment great though not uncommon from which one of the other sex rather than her own a brother rather than a great aunt might have warned her for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown it would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies could they be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted the sprigged the mull or the jackonet woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone no man will admire her the more no woman will like her the better for it neatness and fashion are enough for the former and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter but not one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of catherine she entered the rooms on thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the monday before she had then been exulting in her engagement to thorpe and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight lest he should engage her again for though she could not dared not expect that mr tilney should ask her a third time to dance her wishes hopes and plans all centred in nothing less every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment for every young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation all have been or at least all have believed themselves to be in danger from the pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid and all have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please as soon as they were joined by the thorpes catherine s agony began she fidgeted about if john thorpe came towards her hid herself as much as possible from his view and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him the cotillions were over the country dancing beginning and she saw nothing of the tilneys do not be frightened my dear catherine whispered isabella but i am really going to dance with your brother again i declare positively it is quite shocking i tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself but you and john must keep us in countenance make haste my dear creature and come to us john is just walked off but he will be back in a moment catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer the others walked away john thorpe was still in view and she gave herself up for lost that she might not appear however to observe or expect him she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan and a self condemnation for her folly in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the tilneys in any reasonable time had just passed through her mind when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance by mr tilney himself with what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set may be easily imagined to escape and as she believed so narrowly escape john thorpe and to be asked so immediately on his joining her asked by mr tilney as if he had sought her on purpose it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place however when her attention was claimed by john thorpe who stood behind her heyday miss morland said he what is the meaning of this i thought you and i were to dance together i wonder you should think so for you never asked me that is a good one by jove i asked you as soon as i came into the room and i was just going to ask you again but when i turned round you were gone this is a cursed shabby trick i only came for the sake of dancing with _you_ and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday yes i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famously oh no they will never think of _me_ after such a description as that by heavens if they do not i will kick them out of the room for blockheads what chap have you there catherine satisfied his curiosity tilney he repeated hum i do not know him a good figure of a man well put together does he want a horse here is a friend of mine sam fletcher has got one to sell that would suit anybody a famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the field i would give any money for a real good hunter i have three now the best that ever were backed i would not take eight hundred guineas for them fletcher and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season it is so d uncomfortable living at an inn this was the last sentence by which he could weary catherine s attention for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies her partner now drew near and said that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours but they are such very different things that you think they cannot be compared together to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water _that_ i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison no indeed i never thought of that then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with and is that to be my only security alas alas nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not _want_ to talk to anybody now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before yes quite more so indeed more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond _that_ it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there you are not fond of the country yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country do i do you not i do not believe there is much difference here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen mr tilney was very much amused only go and call on mrs allen he repeated what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i _do_ like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them here their conversation closed the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention soon after their reaching the bottom of the set catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers on immediately behind her partner he was a very handsome man of a commanding aspect past the bloom but not past the vigour of life and with his eye still directed towards her she saw him presently address mr tilney in a familiar whisper confused by his notice and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance she turned away her head but while she did so the gentleman retreated and her partner coming nearer said i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father catherine s answer was only oh but it was an oh expressing everything needful attention to his words and perfect reliance on their truth with real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the general as he moved through the crowd and how handsome a family they are was her secret remark in chatting with miss tilney before the evening concluded a new source of felicity arose to her she had never taken a country walk since her arrival in bath miss tilney to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk some morning or other i shall like it she cried beyond anything in the world and do not let us put it off let us go to morrow this was readily agreed to with only a proviso of miss tilney s that it did not rain which catherine was sure it would not at twelve o clock they were to call for her in pulteney street and remember twelve o clock was her parting speech to her new friend of her other her older her more established friend isabella of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight s experience she scarcely saw anything during the evening yet though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness she cheerfully submitted to the wish of mr allen which took them rather early away and her spirits danced within her as she danced in her chair all the way home chapter 11 the morrow brought a very sober looking morning the sun making only a few efforts to appear and catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes a bright morning so early in the year she allowed would generally turn to rain but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced she applied to mr allen for confirmation of her hopes but mr allen not having his own skies and barometer about him declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine she applied to mrs allen and mrs allen s opinion was more positive she had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day if the clouds would only go off and the sun keep out at about eleven o clock however a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught catherine s watchful eye and oh dear i do believe it will be wet broke from her in a most desponding tone i thought how it would be said mrs allen no walk for me to day sighed catherine but perhaps it may come to nothing or it may hold up before twelve perhaps it may but then my dear it will be so dirty oh that will not signify i never mind dirt no replied her friend very placidly i know you never mind dirt after a short pause it comes on faster and faster said catherine as she stood watching at a window so it does indeed if it keeps raining the streets will be very wet there are four umbrellas up already how i hate the sight of an umbrella they are disagreeable things to carry i would much rather take a chair at any time it was such a nice looking morning i felt so convinced it would be dry anybody would have thought so indeed there will be very few people in the pump room if it rains all the morning i hope mr allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat i wonder he should dislike it it must be so comfortable the rain continued fast though not heavy catherine went every five minutes to the clock threatening on each return that if it still kept on raining another five minutes she would give up the matter as hopeless the clock struck twelve and it still rained you will not be able to go my dear i do not quite despair yet i shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve this is just the time of day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter there it is twenty minutes after twelve and now i _shall_ give it up entirely oh that we had such weather here as they had at udolpho or at least in tuscany and the south of france the night that poor st aubin died such beautiful weather at half past twelve when catherine s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment the sky began voluntarily to clear a gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise she looked round the clouds were parting and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed and justified the opinion of mrs allen who had always thought it would clear up but whether catherine might still expect her friends whether there had not been too much rain for miss tilney to venture must yet be a question it was too dirty for mrs allen to accompany her husband to the pump room he accordingly set off by himself and catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back isabella my brother and mr thorpe i declare they are coming for me perhaps but i shall not go i cannot go indeed for you know miss tilney may still call mrs allen agreed to it john thorpe was soon with them and his voice was with them yet sooner for on the stairs he was calling out to miss morland to be quick make haste make haste as he threw open the door put on your hat this moment there is no time to be lost we are going to bristol how d ye do mrs allen to bristol is not that a great way off but however i cannot go with you to day because i am engaged i expect some friends every moment this was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all mrs allen was called on to second him and the two others walked in to give their assistance my sweetest catherine is not this delightful we shall have a most heavenly drive you are to thank your brother and me for the scheme it darted into our heads at breakfast time i verily believe at the same instant and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain but it does not signify the nights are moonlight and we shall do delightfully oh i am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet so much better than going to the lower rooms we shall drive directly to clifton and dine there and as soon as dinner is over if there is time for it go on to kingsweston i doubt our being able to do so much said morland you croaking fellow cried thorpe we shall be able to do ten times more kingsweston aye and blaize castle too and anything else we can hear of but here is your sister says she will not go blaize castle cried catherine what is that the finest place in england worth going fifty miles at any time to see what is it really a castle an old castle the oldest in the kingdom but is it like what one reads of exactly the very same but now really are there towers and long galleries by dozens then i should like to see it but i cannot i cannot go not go my beloved creature what do you mean i cannot go because looking down as she spoke fearful of isabella s smile i expect miss tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk they promised to come at twelve only it rained but now as it is so fine i dare say they will be here soon not they indeed cried thorpe for as we turned into broad street i saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts i do not know indeed yes i know he does i saw him you are talking of the man you danced with last night are not you yes well i saw him at that moment turn up the lansdown road driving a smart looking girl did you indeed did upon my soul knew him again directly and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too it is very odd but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life walk you could no more walk than you could fly it has not been so dirty the whole winter it is ankle deep everywhere isabella corroborated it my dearest catherine you cannot form an idea of the dirt come you must go you cannot refuse going now i should like to see the castle but may we go all over it may we go up every staircase and into every suite of rooms yes yes every hole and corner but then if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer and call by and by make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks then i will shall i go mrs allen just as you please my dear mrs allen you must persuade her to go was the general cry mrs allen was not inattentive to it well my dear said she suppose you go and in two minutes they were off catherine s feelings as she got into the carriage were in a very unsettled state divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure and the hope of soon enjoying another almost its equal in degree however unlike in kind she could not think the tilneys had acted quite well by her in so readily giving up their engagement without sending her any message of excuse it was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk and in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour she could not from her own observation help thinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience to feel herself slighted by them was very painful on the other hand the delight of exploring an edifice like udolpho as her fancy represented blaize castle to be was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost anything they passed briskly down pulteney street and through laura place without the exchange of many words thorpe talked to his horse and she meditated by turns on broken promises and broken arches phaetons and false hangings tilneys and trap doors as they entered argyle buildings however she was roused by this address from her companion who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by who where on the right hand pavement she must be almost out of sight now catherine looked round and saw miss tilney leaning on her brother s arm walking slowly down the street she saw them both looking back at her stop stop mr thorpe she impatiently cried it is miss tilney it is indeed how could you tell me they were gone stop stop i will get out this moment and go to them but to what purpose did she speak thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot the tilneys who had soon ceased to look after her were in a moment out of sight round the corner of laura place and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace still however and during the length of another street she entreated him to stop pray pray stop mr thorpe i cannot go on i will not go on i must go back to miss tilney but mr thorpe only laughed smacked his whip encouraged his horse made odd noises and drove on and catherine angry and vexed as she was having no power of getting away was obliged to give up the point and submit her reproaches however were not spared how could you deceive me so mr thorpe how could you say that you saw them driving up the lansdown road i would not have had it happen so for the world they must think it so strange so rude of me to go by them too without saying a word you do not know how vexed i am i shall have no pleasure at clifton nor in anything else i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now and walk back to them how could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton thorpe defended himself very stoutly declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life and would hardly give up the point of its having been tilney himself their drive even when this subject was over was not likely to be very agreeable catherine s complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing she listened reluctantly and her replies were short blaize castle remained her only comfort towards _that_ she still looked at intervals with pleasure though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk and especially rather than be thought ill of by the tilneys she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its walls could supply the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture though now for many years deserted the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow winding vaults by a low grated door or even of having their lamp their only lamp extinguished by a sudden gust of wind and of being left in total darkness in the meanwhile they proceeded on their journey without any mischance and were within view of the town of keynsham when a halloo from morland who was behind them made his friend pull up to know what was the matter the others then came close enough for conversation and morland said we had better go back thorpe it is too late to go on to day your sister thinks so as well as i we have been exactly an hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven miles and i suppose we have at least eight more to go it will never do we set out a great deal too late we had much better put it off till another day and turn round it is all one to me replied thorpe rather angrily and instantly turning his horse they were on their way back to bath if your brother had not got such a d beast to drive said he soon afterwards we might have done it very well my horse would have trotted to clifton within the hour if left to himself and i have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken winded jade s pace morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own no he is not said catherine warmly for i am sure he could not afford it and why cannot he afford it because he has not money enough and whose fault is that nobody s that i know of thorpe then said something in the loud incoherent way to which he had often recourse about its being a d thing to be miserly and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things he did not know who could which catherine did not even endeavour to understand disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so and they returned to pulteney street without her speaking twenty words as she entered the house the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off that when he told them she was gone out with mr thorpe the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her and on his saying no had felt for a card but said she had none about her and went away pondering over these heart rending tidings catherine walked slowly upstairs at the head of them she was met by mr allen who on hearing the reason of their speedy return said i am glad your brother had so much sense i am glad you are come back it was a strange wild scheme they all spent the evening together at thorpe s catherine was disturbed and out of spirits but isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce in the fate of which she shared by private partnership with morland a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at clifton her satisfaction too in not being at the lower rooms was spoken more than once how i pity the poor creatures that are going there how glad i am that i am not amongst them i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not they have not begun dancing yet i would not be there for all the world it is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself i dare say it will not be a very good ball i know the mitchells will not be there i am sure i pity everybody that is but i dare say mr morland you long to be at it do not you i am sure you do well pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you i dare say we could do very well without you but you men think yourselves of such consequence catherine could almost have accused isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered do not be so dull my dearest creature she whispered you will quite break my heart it was amazingly shocking to be sure but the tilneys were entirely to blame why were not they more punctual it was dirty indeed but what did that signify i am sure john and i should not have minded it i never mind going through anything where a friend is concerned that is my disposition and john is just the same he has amazing strong feelings good heavens what a delightful hand you have got kings i vow i never was so happy in my life i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself and now i may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch which is the true heroine s portion to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears and lucky may she think herself if she get another good night s rest in the course of the next three months chapter 12 mrs allen said catherine the next morning will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney to day i shall not be easy till i have explained everything go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white catherine cheerfully complied and being properly equipped was more impatient than ever to be at the pump room that she might inform herself of general tilney s lodgings for though she believed they were in milsom street she was not certain of the house and mrs allen s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful to milsom street she was directed and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven tripping lightly through the church yard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see her beloved isabella and her dear family who she had reason to believe were in a shop hard by she reached the house without any impediment looked at the number knocked at the door and inquired for miss tilney the man believed miss tilney to be at home but was not quite certain would she be pleased to send up her name she gave her card in a few minutes the servant returned and with a look which did not quite confirm his words said he had been mistaken for that miss tilney was walked out catherine with a blush of mortification left the house she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney _was_ at home and too much offended to admit her and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at the drawing room windows in expectation of seeing her there but no one appeared at them at the bottom of the street however she looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she saw miss tilney herself she was followed by a gentleman whom catherine believed to be her father and they turned up towards edgar s buildings catherine in deep mortification proceeded on her way she could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility but she checked the resentful sensation she remembered her own ignorance she knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable dejected and humbled she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night but it must be confessed that they were not of long continuance for she soon recollected in the first place that she was without any excuse for staying at home and in the second that it was a play she wanted very much to see to the theatre accordingly they all went no tilneys appeared to plague or please her she feared that amongst the many perfections of the family a fondness for plays was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the london stage which she knew on isabella s authority rendered everything else of the kind quite horrid she was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure the comedy so well suspended her care that no one observing her during the first four acts would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her on the beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mr henry tilney and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch henry tilney without being once able to catch his eye no longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes at length however he did look towards her and he bowed but such a bow no smile no continued observance attended it his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction catherine was restlessly miserable she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation instead of proudly resolving in conscious innocence to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct or at least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause the play concluded the curtain fell henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat but his father remained and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box she was right in a few minutes he appeared and making his way through the then thinning rows spoke with like calm politeness to mrs allen and her friend not with such calmness was he answered by the latter oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen my dear you tumble my gown was mrs allen s reply her assurance however standing sole as it did was not thrown away it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration henry tilney at least was not with a yet sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sister s concern regret and dependence on catherine s honour oh do not say miss tilney was not angry cried catherine because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible catherine s mind was greatly eased by this information yet a something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly artless in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman but mr tilney why were _you_ less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should _you_ be so ready to take offence me i take offence nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry i angry i could have no right well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play he remained with them some time and was only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away before they parted however it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box she was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in the world while talking to each other she had observed with some surprise that john thorpe who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together was engaged in conversation with general tilney and she felt something more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse what could they have to say of her she feared general tilney did not like her appearance she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes how came mr thorpe to know your father was her anxious inquiry as she pointed them out to her companion he knew nothing about it but his father like every military man had a very large acquaintance when the entertainment was over thorpe came to assist them in getting out catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry and while they waited in the lobby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue by asking in a consequential manner whether she had seen him talking with general tilney he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great regard for him i assure you a gentleman like good sort of fellow as ever lived but how came you to know him know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again to day the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i _did_ beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew i should like to dine with him i dare say he gives famous dinners but what do you think we have been talking of you yes by heavens and the general thinks you the finest girl in bath oh nonsense how can you say so and what do you think i said lowering his voice well done general said i i am quite of your mind here catherine who was much less gratified by his admiration than by general tilney s was not sorry to be called away by mr allen thorpe however would see her to her chair and till she entered it continued the same kind of delicate flattery in spite of her entreating him to have done that general tilney instead of disliking should admire her was very delightful and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet the evening had done more much more for her than could have been expected chapter 13 monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and saturday have now passed in review before the reader the events of each day its hopes and fears mortifications and pleasures have been separately stated and the pangs of sunday only now remain to be described and close the week the clifton scheme had been deferred not relinquished and on the afternoon s crescent of this day it was brought forward again in a private consultation between isabella and james the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her it was agreed that provided the weather were fair the party should take place on the following morning and they were to set off very early in order to be at home in good time the affair thus determined and thorpe s approbation secured catherine only remained to be apprised of it she had left them for a few minutes to speak to miss tilney in that interval the plan was completed and as soon as she came again her agreement was demanded but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by isabella catherine looked grave was very sorry but could not go the engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her to accompany them now she had that moment settled with miss tilney to take their proposed walk to morrow it was quite determined and she would not upon any account retract but that she _must_ and _should_ retract was instantly the eager cry of both the thorpes they must go to clifton to morrow they would not go without her it would be nothing to put off a mere walk for one day longer and they would not hear of a refusal catherine was distressed but not subdued do not urge me isabella i am engaged to miss tilney i cannot go this availed nothing the same arguments assailed her again she must go she should go and they would not hear of a refusal it would be so easy to tell miss tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement and must only beg to put off the walk till tuesday no it would not be easy i could not do it there has been no prior engagement but isabella became only more and more urgent calling on her in the most affectionate manner addressing her by the most endearing names she was sure her dearest sweetest catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly she knew her beloved catherine to have so feeling a heart so sweet a temper to be so easily persuaded by those she loved but all in vain catherine felt herself to be in the right and though pained by such tender such flattering supplication could not allow it to influence her isabella then tried another method she reproached her with having more affection for miss tilney though she had known her so little a while than for her best and oldest friends with being grown cold and indifferent in short towards herself i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted for strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections are placed it is not in the power of anything to change them but i believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s i am sure they are too strong for my own peace and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick i own these tilneys seem to swallow up everything else catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish regardless of everything but her own gratification these painful ideas crossed her mind though she said nothing isabella in the meanwhile had applied her handkerchief to her eyes and morland miserable at such a sight could not help saying nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse this was the first time of her brother s openly siding against her and anxious to avoid his displeasure she proposed a compromise if they would only put off their scheme till tuesday which they might easily do as it depended only on themselves she could go with them and everybody might then be satisfied but no no no was the immediate answer that could not be for thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on tuesday catherine was sorry but could do no more and a short silence ensued which was broken by isabella who in a voice of cold resentment said very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing catherine you must go said james but why cannot mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters i dare say either of them would like to go thank ye cried thorpe but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you that is a compliment which gives me no pleasure but her words were lost on thorpe who had turned abruptly away the three others still continued together walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor catherine sometimes not a word was said sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches and her arm was still linked within isabella s though their hearts were at war at one moment she was softened at another irritated always distressed but always steady i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine said james you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters i hope i am not less so now she replied very feelingly but indeed i cannot go if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right i suspect said isabella in a low voice there is no great struggle catherine s heart swelled she drew away her arm and isabella made no opposition thus passed a long ten minutes till they were again joined by thorpe who coming to them with a gayer look said well i have settled the matter and now we may all go to morrow with a safe conscience i have been to miss tilney and made your excuses you have not cried catherine i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us to morrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey isabella s countenance was once more all smiles and good humour and james too looked happy again a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party this will not do said catherine i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right isabella however caught hold of one hand thorpe of the other and remonstrances poured in from all three even james was quite angry when everything was settled when miss tilney herself said that tuesday would suit her as well it was quite ridiculous quite absurd to make any further objection i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the tilneys they were turning the corner into brock street when he had overtaken them and were at home by this time then i will go after them said catherine wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it and with these words she broke away and hurried off thorpe would have darted after her but morland withheld him let her go let her go if she will go she is as obstinate as thorpe never finished the simile for it could hardly have been a proper one away walked catherine in great agitation as fast as the crowd would permit her fearful of being pursued yet determined to persevere as she walked she reflected on what had passed it was painful to her to disappoint and displease them particularly to displease her brother but she could not repent her resistance setting her own inclination apart to have failed a second time in her engagement to miss tilney to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before and on a false pretence too must have been wrong she had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone she had not consulted merely her own gratification _that_ might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself by seeing blaize castle no she had attended to what was due to others and to her own character in their opinion her conviction of being right however was not enough to restore her composure till she had spoken to miss tilney she could not be at ease and quickening her pace when she got clear of the crescent she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of milsom street so rapid had been her movements that in spite of the tilneys advantage in the outset they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them and the servant still remaining at the open door she used only the ceremony of saying that she must speak with miss tilney that moment and hurrying by him proceeded upstairs then opening the first door before her which happened to be the right she immediately found herself in the drawing room with general tilney his son and daughter her explanation defective only in being from her irritation of nerves and shortness of breath no explanation at all was instantly given i am come in a great hurry it was all a mistake i never promised to go i told them from the first i could not go i ran away in a great hurry to explain it i did not care what you thought of me i would not stay for the servant the business however though not perfectly elucidated by this speech soon ceased to be a puzzle catherine found that john thorpe _had_ given the message and miss tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it but whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment catherine though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication had no means of knowing whatever might have been felt before her arrival her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire the affair thus happily settled she was introduced by miss tilney to her father and received by him with such ready such solicitous politeness as recalled thorpe s information to her mind and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on to such anxious attention was the general s civility carried that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself what did william mean by it he should make a point of inquiring into the matter and if catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence it seemed likely that william would lose the favour of his master forever if not his place by her rapidity after sitting with them a quarter of an hour she rose to take leave and was then most agreeably surprised by general tilney s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her miss tilney added her own wishes catherine was greatly obliged but it was quite out of her power mr and mrs allen would expect her back every moment the general declared he could say no more the claims of mr and mrs allen were not to be superseded but on some other day he trusted when longer notice could be given they would not refuse to spare her to her friend oh no catherine was sure they would not have the least objection and she should have great pleasure in coming the general attended her himself to the street door saying everything gallant as they went downstairs admiring the elasticity of her walk which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld when they parted catherine delighted by all that had passed proceeded gaily to pulteney street walking as she concluded with great elasticity though she had never thought of it before she reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party and now that she had been triumphant throughout had carried her point and was secure of her walk she began as the flutter of her spirits subsided to doubt whether she had been perfectly right a sacrifice was always noble and if she had given way to their entreaties she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased a brother angry and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed perhaps through her means to ease her mind and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been she took occasion to mention before mr allen the half settled scheme of her brother and the thorpes for the following day mr allen caught at it directly well said he and do you think of going too no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i no certainly not and i am glad you do not think of it these schemes are not at all the thing young men and women driving about the country in open carriages now and then it is very well but going to inns and public places together it is not right and i wonder mrs thorpe should allow it i am glad you do not think of going i am sure mrs morland would not be pleased mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking do not you think these kind of projects objectionable yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed i cannot bear to see it dear madam cried catherine then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people _will_ be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done said mr allen and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more that is just what i was going to say added his wife catherine relieved for herself felt uneasy for isabella and after a moment s thought asked mr allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to miss thorpe and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself for she considered that isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to clifton the next day in spite of what had passed mr allen however discouraged her from doing any such thing you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her mrs thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt but however you had better not interfere she and your brother choose to go and you will be only getting ill will catherine submitted and though sorry to think that isabella should be doing wrong felt greatly relieved by mr allen s approbation of her own conduct and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself her escape from being one of the party to clifton was now an escape indeed for what would the tilneys have thought of her if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety only to enable her to be guilty of another chapter 14 the next morning was fair and catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled party with mr allen to support her she felt no dread of the event but she would gladly be spared a contest where victory itself was painful and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them the tilneys called for her at the appointed time and no new difficulty arising no sudden recollection no unexpected summons no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their measures my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement though it was made with the hero himself they determined on walking round beechen cliff that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object from almost every opening in bath i never look at it said catherine as they walked along the side of the river without thinking of the south of france you have been abroad then said henry a little surprised oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say why not because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time yes added miss tilney and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly it is _amazingly _ it may well suggest _amazement_ if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding henry said miss tilney you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way i am sure cried catherine i did not mean to say anything wrong but it _is_ a nice book and why should not i call it so very true said henry and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word while in fact cried his sister it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading to say the truth i do not much like any other indeed that is i can read poetry and plays and things of that sort and do not dislike travels but history real solemn history i cannot be interested in can you yes i am fond of history i wish i were too i read it a little as a duty but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me the quarrels of popes and kings with wars or pestilences in every page the men all so good for nothing and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome and yet i often think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention the speeches that are put into the heroes mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention and invention is what delights me in other books historians you think said miss tilney are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it that little boys and girls should be tormented said henry is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to _torment_ and to _instruct_ might sometimes be used as synonymous words very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all catherine assented and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady s merits closed the subject the tilneys were soon engaged in another on which she had nothing to say they were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures with all the eagerness of real taste here catherine was quite lost she knew nothing of drawing nothing of taste and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little profit for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her the little which she could understand however appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before it seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of an high hill and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of a fine day she was heartily ashamed of her ignorance a misplaced shame where people wish to attach they should always be ignorant to come with a well informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others which a sensible person would always wish to avoid a woman especially if she have the misfortune of knowing anything should conceal it as well as she can the advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author and to her treatment of the subject i will only add in justice to men that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex imbecility in females is a great enhancement of their personal charms there is a portion of them too reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance but catherine did not know her own advantages did not know that a good looking girl with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind cannot fail of attracting a clever young man unless circumstances are particularly untoward in the present instance she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed in which his instructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in everything admired by him and her attention was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste he talked of foregrounds distances and second distances side screens and perspectives lights and shades and catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of beechen cliff she voluntarily rejected the whole city of bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape delighted with her progress and fearful of wearying her with too much wisdom at once henry suffered the subject to decline and by an easy transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak which he had placed near its summit to oaks in general to forests the enclosure of them waste lands crown lands and government he shortly found himself arrived at politics and from politics it was an easy step to silence the general pause which succeeded his short disquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by catherine who in rather a solemn tone of voice uttered these words i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london miss tilney to whom this was chiefly addressed was startled and hastily replied indeed and of what nature that i do not know nor who is the author i have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet good heaven where could you hear of such a thing a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind you speak with astonishing composure but i hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect government said henry endeavouring not to smile neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much the ladies stared he laughed and added come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot riot what riot my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general catherine looked grave and now henry said miss tilney that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways i shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them no doubt but that is no explanation of the present what am i to do you know what you ought to do clear your character handsomely before her tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women miss morland i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company that is not enough be more serious miss morland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland he is not in a sober mood but i do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me it was no effort to catherine to believe that henry tilney could never be wrong his manner might sometimes surprise but his meaning must always be just and what she did not understand she was almost as ready to admire as what she did the whole walk was delightful and though it ended too soon its conclusion was delightful too her friends attended her into the house and miss tilney before they parted addressing herself with respectful form as much to mrs allen as to catherine petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next no difficulty was made on mrs allen s side and the only difficulty on catherine s was in concealing the excess of her pleasure the morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her friendship and natural affection for no thought of isabella or james had crossed her during their walk when the tilneys were gone she became amiable again but she was amiable for some time to little effect mrs allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety she had heard nothing of any of them towards the end of the morning however catherine having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment s delay walked out into the town and in bond street overtook the second miss thorpe as she was loitering towards edgar s buildings between two of the sweetest girls in the world who had been her dear friends all the morning from her she soon learned that the party to clifton had taken place they set off at eight this morning said miss anne and i am sure i do not envy them their drive i think you and i are very well off to be out of the scrape it must be the dullest thing in the world for there is not a soul at clifton at this time of year belle went with your brother and john drove maria catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of the arrangement oh yes rejoined the other maria is gone she was quite wild to go she thought it would be something very fine i cannot say i admire her taste and for my part i was determined from the first not to go if they pressed me ever so much catherine a little doubtful of this could not help answering i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go thank you but it is quite a matter of indifference to me indeed i would not have gone on any account i was saying so to emily and sophia when you overtook us catherine was still unconvinced but glad that anne should have the friendship of an emily and a sophia to console her she bade her adieu without much uneasiness and returned home pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either james or isabella to resent her resistance any longer chapter 15 early the next day a note from isabella speaking peace and tenderness in every line and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance hastened catherine in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity to edgar s buildings the two youngest miss thorpes were by themselves in the parlour and on anne s quitting it to call her sister catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday s party maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it and catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world that nobody could imagine how charming it had been and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive such was the information of the first five minutes the second unfolded thus much in detail that they had driven directly to the york hotel ate some soup and bespoke an early dinner walked down to the pump room tasted the water and laid out some shillings in purses and spars thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry cook s and hurrying back to the hotel swallowed their dinner in haste to prevent being in the dark and then had a delightful drive back only the moon was not up and it rained a little and mr morland s horse was so tired he could hardly get it along catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction it appeared that blaize castle had never been thought of and as for all the rest there was nothing to regret for half an instant maria s intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister anne whom she represented as insupportably cross from being excluded the party she will never forgive me i am sure but you know how could i help it john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had such thick ankles i dare say she will not be in good humour again this month but i am determined i will not be cross it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper isabella now entered the room with so eager a step and a look of such happy importance as engaged all her friend s notice maria was without ceremony sent away and isabella embracing catherine thus began yes my dear catherine it is so indeed your penetration has not deceived you oh that arch eye of yours it sees through everything catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance nay my beloved sweetest friend continued the other compose yourself i am amazingly agitated as you perceive let us sit down and talk in comfort well and so you guessed it the moment you had my note sly creature oh my dear catherine you alone who know my heart can judge of my present happiness your brother is the most charming of men i only wish i were more worthy of him but what will your excellent father and mother say oh heavens when i think of them i am so agitated catherine s understanding began to awake an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind and with the natural blush of so new an emotion she cried out good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james this bold surmise however she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact the anxious affection which she was accused of having continually watched in isabella s every look and action had in the course of their yesterday s party received the delightful confession of an equal love her heart and faith were alike engaged to james never had catherine listened to anything so full of interest wonder and joy her brother and her friend engaged new to such circumstances the importance of it appeared unspeakably great and she contemplated it as one of those grand events of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return the strength of her feelings she could not express the nature of them however contented her friend the happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion and the fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy delighting however as catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the connection it must be acknowledged that isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations you will be so infinitely dearer to me my catherine than either anne or maria i feel that i shall be so much more attached to my dear morland s family than to my own this was a pitch of friendship beyond catherine you are so like your dear brother continued isabella that i quite doted on you the first moment i saw you but so it always is with me the first moment settles everything the very first day that morland came to us last christmas the very first moment i beheld him my heart was irrecoverably gone i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braids and when i came into the drawing room and john introduced him i thought i never saw anybody so handsome before here catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love for though exceedingly fond of her brother and partial to all his endowments she had never in her life thought him handsome i remember too miss andrews drank tea with us that evening and wore her puce coloured sarsenet and she looked so heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her i could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it oh catherine the many sleepless nights i have had on your brother s account i would not have you suffer half what i have done i am grown wretchedly thin i know but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety you have seen enough of it i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church but my secret i was always sure would be safe with _you_ catherine felt that nothing could have been safer but ashamed of an ignorance little expected she dared no longer contest the point nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as isabella chose to consider her her brother she found was preparing to set off with all speed to fullerton to make known his situation and ask consent and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of isabella catherine endeavoured to persuade her as she was herself persuaded that her father and mother would never oppose their son s wishes it is impossible said she for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children s happiness i have no doubt of their consenting immediately morland says exactly the same replied isabella and yet i dare not expect it my fortune will be so small they never can consent to it your brother who might marry anybody here catherine again discerned the force of love indeed isabella you are too humble the difference of fortune can be nothing to signify oh my sweet catherine in _your_ generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were reversed had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice this charming sentiment recommended as much by sense as novelty gave catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea i am sure they will consent was her frequent declaration i am sure they will be delighted with you for my own part said isabella my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me where people are really attached poverty itself is wealth grandeur i detest i would not settle in london for the universe a cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy there are some charming little villas about richmond richmond cried catherine you must settle near fullerton you must be near us i am sure i shall be miserable if we do not if i can but be near _you_ i shall be satisfied but this is idle talking i will not allow myself to think of such things till we have your father s answer morland says that by sending it to night to salisbury we may have it to morrow to morrow i know i shall never have courage to open the letter i know it will be the death of me a reverie succeeded this conviction and when isabella spoke again it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding gown their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for wiltshire catherine wished to congratulate him but knew not what to say and her eloquence was only in her eyes from them however the eight parts of speech shone out most expressively and james could combine them with ease impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home his adieus were not long and they would have been yet shorter had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone indeed morland i must drive you away consider how far you have to ride i cannot bear to see you linger so for heaven s sake waste no more time there go go i insist on it the two friends with hearts now more united than ever were inseparable for the day and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along mrs thorpe and her son who were acquainted with everything and who seemed only to want mr morland s consent to consider isabella s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family were allowed to join their counsels and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters to catherine s simple feelings this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant nor consistently supported and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out had its inconsistency been less their friend but anne and maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their i know what and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit a display of family ingenuity on one side in the mystery of an affected secret on the other of undefined discovery all equally acute catherine was with her friend again the next day endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters a needful exertion for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near isabella became more and more desponding and before the letter arrived had worked herself into a state of real distress but when it did come where could distress be found i have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness were the first three lines and in one moment all was joyful security the brightest glow was instantly spread over isabella s features all care and anxiety seemed removed her spirits became almost too high for control and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals mrs thorpe with tears of joy embraced her daughter her son her visitor and could have embraced half the inhabitants of bath with satisfaction her heart was overflowing with tenderness it was dear john and dear catherine at every word dear anne and dear maria must immediately be made sharers in their felicity and two dears at once before the name of isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned john himself was no skulker in joy he not only bestowed on mr morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world but swore off many sentences in his praise the letter whence sprang all this felicity was short containing little more than this assurance of success and every particular was deferred till james could write again but for particulars isabella could well afford to wait the needful was comprised in mr morland s promise his honour was pledged to make everything easy and by what means their income was to be formed whether landed property were to be resigned or funded money made over was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern she knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities she saw herself at the end of a few weeks the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at fullerton the envy of every valued old friend in putney with a carriage at her command a new name on her tickets and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger when the contents of the letter were ascertained john thorpe who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to london prepared to set off well miss morland said he on finding her alone in the parlour i am come to bid you good bye catherine wished him a good journey without appearing to hear her he walked to the window fidgeted about hummed a tune and seemed wholly self occupied shall not you be late at devizes said catherine he made no answer but after a minute s silence burst out with a famous good thing this marrying scheme upon my soul a clever fancy of morland s and belle s what do you think of it miss morland _i_ say it is no bad notion i am sure i think it a very good one do you that s honest by heavens i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony however did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another i say you will come to belle s wedding i hope yes i have promised your sister to be with her if possible and then you know twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh i say then you know we may try the truth of this same old song may we but i never sing well i wish you a good journey i dine with miss tilney to day and must now be going home nay but there is no such confounded hurry who knows when we may be together again not but that i shall be down again by the end of a fortnight and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me then why do you stay away so long replied catherine finding that he waited for an answer that is kind of you however kind and good natured i shall not forget it in a hurry but you have more good nature and all that than anybody living i believe a monstrous deal of good nature and it is not only good nature but you have so much so much of everything and then you have such upon my soul i do not know anybody like you oh dear there are a great many people like me i dare say only a great deal better good morning to you but i say miss morland i shall come and pay my respects at fullerton before it is long if not disagreeable pray do my father and mother will be very glad to see you and i hope i hope miss morland _you_ will not be sorry to see me oh dear not at all there are very few people i am sorry to see company is always cheerful that is just my way of thinking give me but a little cheerful company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest say i and i am heartily glad to hear you say the same but i have a notion miss morland you and i think pretty much alike upon most matters perhaps we may but it is more than i ever thought of and as to _most matters_ to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better very true i think like you there if there is a good fortune on one side there can be no occasion for any on the other no matter which has it so that there is enough i hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another and to marry for money i think the wickedest thing in existence good day we shall be very glad to see you at fullerton whenever it is convenient and away she went it was not in the power of all his gallantry to detain her longer with such news to communicate and such a visit to prepare for her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge and she hurried away leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address and her explicit encouragement the agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in mr and mrs allen by the communication of the wonderful event how great was her disappointment the important affair which many words of preparation ushered in had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother s arrival and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people s happiness with a remark on the gentleman s side in favour of isabella s beauty and on the lady s of her great good luck it was to catherine the most surprising insensibility the disclosure however of the great secret of james s going to fullerton the day before did raise some emotion in mrs allen she could not listen to that with perfect calmness but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment wished she could have known his intention wished she could have seen him before he went as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother and her kind compliments to all the skinners chapter 16 catherine s expectations of pleasure from her visit in milsom street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable and accordingly though she was most politely received by general tilney and kindly welcomed by his daughter though henry was at home and no one else of the party she found on her return without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with miss tilney from the intercourse of the day she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before instead of seeing henry tilney to greater advantage than ever in the ease of a family party he had never said so little nor been so little agreeable and in spite of their father s great civilities to her in spite of his thanks invitations and compliments it had been a release to get away from him it puzzled her to account for all this it could not be general tilney s fault that he was perfectly agreeable and good natured and altogether a very charming man did not admit of a doubt for he was tall and handsome and henry s father _he_ could not be accountable for his children s want of spirits or for her want of enjoyment in his company the former she hoped at last might have been accidental and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity isabella on hearing the particulars of the visit gave a different explanation it was all pride pride insufferable haughtiness and pride she had long suspected the family to be very high and this made it certain such insolence of behaviour as miss tilney s she had never heard of in her life not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding to behave to her guest with such superciliousness hardly even to speak to her but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil oh don t defend her and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you good heavens well some people s feelings are incomprehensible and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits how contemptible of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine indeed he is unworthy of you unworthy i do not suppose he ever thinks of me that is exactly what i say he never thinks of you such fickleness oh how different to your brother and to mine i really believe john has the most constant heart but as for general tilney i assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy oh i know no harm of him i do not suspect him of pride i believe he is a very gentleman like man john thinks very well of him and john s judgment well i shall see how they behave to me this evening we shall meet them at the rooms and must i go do not you intend it i thought it was all settled nay since you make such a point of it i can refuse you nothing but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off and as for dancing do not mention it i beg _that_ is quite out of the question charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guesses the reason and that is exactly what i want to avoid so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself isabella s opinion of the tilneys did not influence her friend she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts the evening rewarded her confidence she was met by one with the same kindness and by the other with the same attention as heretofore miss tilney took pains to be near her and henry asked her to dance having heard the day before in milsom street that their elder brother captain tilney was expected almost every hour she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable looking handsome young man whom she had never seen before and who now evidently belonged to their party she looked at him with great admiration and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother though in her eyes his air was more assuming and his countenance less prepossessing his taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior for within her hearing he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself but even laughed openly at henry for finding it possible from the latter circumstance it may be presumed that whatever might be our heroine s opinion of him his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind not likely to produce animosities between the brothers nor persecutions to the lady _he_ cannot be the instigator of the three villains in horsemen s greatcoats by whom she will hereafter be forced into a traveling chaise and four which will drive off with incredible speed catherine meanwhile undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil or of any evil at all except that of having but a short set to dance down enjoyed her usual happiness with henry tilney listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said and in finding him irresistible becoming so herself at the end of the first dance captain tilney came towards them again and much to catherine s dissatisfaction pulled his brother away they retired whispering together and though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm and lay it down as fact that captain tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her which he now hastened to communicate to his brother in the hope of separating them forever she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations her suspense was of full five minutes duration and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour when they both returned and an explanation was given by henry s requesting to know if she thought her friend miss thorpe would have any objection to dancing as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her catherine without hesitation replied that she was very sure miss thorpe did not mean to dance at all the cruel reply was passed on to the other and he immediately walked away your brother will not mind it i know said she because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world henry smiled and said how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions why what do you mean with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should _i_ be influenced what would be _my_ inducement in acting so and so i do not understand you then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible bravo an excellent satire on modern language but pray tell me what you mean shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us no no it shall not do either i am not afraid well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world catherine blushed and disclaimed and the gentleman s predictions were verified there was a something however in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time forgetting to speak or to listen and almost forgetting where she was till roused by the voice of isabella she looked up and saw her with captain tilney preparing to give them hands across isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given but as it was not quite enough for catherine s comprehension she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance and did isabella never change her mind before oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself you are laughing but i assure you isabella is very firm in general it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour the friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over but then as they walked about the room arm in arm isabella thus explained herself i do not wonder at your surprise and i am really fatigued to death he is such a rattle amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged but i would have given the world to sit still then why did not you oh my dear it would have looked so particular and you know how i abhor doing that i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial you have no idea how he pressed me i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner but no not he after aspiring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me oh such nonsense i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me for of all things in the world i hated fine speeches and compliments and so and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening i am so glad it is over my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us he is very handsome indeed handsome yes i suppose he may i dare say people would admire him in general but he is not at all in my style of beauty i hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man however he is very well amazingly conceited i am sure i took him down several times you know in my way when the young ladies next met they had a far more interesting subject to discuss james morland s second letter was then received and the kind intentions of his father fully explained a living of which mr morland was himself patron and incumbent of about four hundred pounds yearly value was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it no trifling deduction from the family income no niggardly assignment to one of ten children an estate of at least equal value moreover was assured as his future inheritance james expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry being however unwelcome no more than he had expected was borne by him without discontent catherine whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father s income and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother felt equally well satisfied and heartily congratulated isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled it is very charming indeed said isabella with a grave face mr morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed said the gentle mrs thorpe looking anxiously at her daughter i only wish i could do as much one could not expect more from him you know if he finds he _can_ do more by and by i dare say he will for i am sure he must be an excellent good hearted man four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear it is not on my own account i wish for more but i cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life for myself it is nothing i never think of myself i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man nobody can think better of mr morland than i do i am sure but everybody has their failing you know and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money catherine was hurt by these insinuations i am very sure said she that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford isabella recollected herself as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living yes yes my darling isabella said mrs thorpe we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection catherine s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen she endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of isabella s regret and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise james soon followed his letter and was received with the most gratifying kindness chapter 17 the allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in bath and whether it should be the last was for some time a question to which catherine listened with a beating heart to have her acquaintance with the tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance her whole happiness seemed at stake while the affair was in suspense and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should be taken for another fortnight what this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing henry tilney made but a small part of catherine s speculation once or twice indeed since james s engagement had taught her what _could_ be done she had got so far as to indulge in a secret perhaps but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views the present was now comprised in another three weeks and her happiness being certain for that period the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest in the course of the morning which saw this business arranged she visited miss tilney and poured forth her joyful feelings it was doomed to be a day of trial no sooner had she expressed her delight in mr allen s lengthened stay than miss tilney told her of her father s having just determined upon quitting bath by the end of another week here was a blow the past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment catherine s countenance fell and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed miss tilney s concluding words by the end of another week yes my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in a hurry to get home i am very sorry for it said catherine dejectedly if i had known this before perhaps said miss tilney in an embarrassed manner you would be so good it would make me very happy if the entrance of her father put a stop to the civility which catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding after addressing her with his usual politeness he turned to his daughter and said well eleanor may i congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in well proceed by all means i know how much your heart is in it my daughter miss morland he continued without leaving his daughter time to speak has been forming a very bold wish we leave bath as she has perhaps told you on saturday se nnight a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the marquis of longtown and general courteney here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath and could we carry our selfish point with you we should leave it without a single regret can you in short be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend eleanor with your company in gloucestershire i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in bath than yourself modesty such as yours but not for the world would i pain it by open praise if you can be induced to honour us with a visit you will make us happy beyond expression tis true we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour for our mode of living as you see is plain and unpretending yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable northanger abbey these were thrilling words and wound up catherine s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness to receive so flattering an invitation to have her company so warmly solicited everything honourable and soothing every present enjoyment and every future hope was contained in it and her acceptance with only the saving clause of papa and mamma s approbation was eagerly given i will write home directly said she and if they do not object as i dare say they will not general tilney was not less sanguine having already waited on her excellent friends in pulteney street and obtained their sanction of his wishes since they can consent to part with you said he we may expect philosophy from all the world miss tilney was earnest though gentle in her secondary civilities and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to fullerton would allow the circumstances of the morning had led catherine s feelings through the varieties of suspense security and disappointment but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss and with spirits elated to rapture with henry at her heart and northanger abbey on her lips she hurried home to write her letter mr and mrs morland relying on the discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their daughter felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in gloucestershire this indulgence though not more than catherine had hoped for completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature in friends and fortune circumstance and chance everything seemed to cooperate for her advantage by the kindness of her first friends the allens she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her her feelings her preferences had each known the happiness of a return wherever she felt attachment she had been able to create it the affection of isabella was to be secured to her in a sister the tilneys they by whom above all she desired to be favourably thought of outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued she was to be their chosen visitor she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized and in addition to all the rest this roof was to be the roof of an abbey her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for henry tilney and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill to see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one or the cloisters of the other had been for many weeks a darling wish though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire and yet this was to happen with all the chances against her of house hall place park court and cottage northanger turned up an abbey and she was to be its inhabitant its long damp passages its narrow cells and ruined chapel were to be within her daily reach and she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends some awful memorials of an injured and ill fated nun it was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home that the consciousness of it should be so meekly borne the power of early habit only could account for it a distinction to which they had been born gave no pride their superiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority of person many were the inquiries she was eager to make of miss tilney but so active were her thoughts that when these inquiries were answered she was hardly more assured than before of northanger abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the reformation of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the tilneys on its dissolution of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed or of its standing low in a valley sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak chapter 18 with a mind thus full of happiness catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away without her seeing isabella for more than a few minutes together she began first to be sensible of this and to sigh for her conversation as she walked along the pump room one morning by mrs allen s side without anything to say or to hear and scarcely had she felt a five minutes longing of friendship before the object of it appeared and inviting her to a secret conference led the way to a seat this is my favourite place said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either it is so out of the way catherine observing that isabella s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other as in eager expectation and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch thought the present a fine opportunity for being really so and therefore gaily said do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here psha my dear creature she replied do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow it would be hideous to be always together we should be the jest of the place and so you are going to northanger i am amazingly glad of it it is one of the finest old places in england i understand i shall depend upon a most particular description of it you shall certainly have the best in my power to give but who are you looking for are your sisters coming i am not looking for anybody one s eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles off i am amazingly absent i believe i am the most absent creature in the world tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me oh yes and so i have but here is a proof of what i was saying my poor head i had quite forgot it well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john you can guess the contents no indeed i cannot my sweet love do not be so abominably affected what can he write about but yourself you know he is over head and ears in love with you with _me_ dear isabella nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance catherine with all the earnestness of truth expressed her astonishment at such a charge protesting her innocence of every thought of mr thorpe s being in love with her and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming and as to making me an offer or anything like it there must be some unaccountable mistake i could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind you know and as i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us the last half hour before he went away it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning but _that_ you certainly did for you spent the whole morning in edgar s buildings it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house are you well if you say it it was so i dare say but for the life of me i cannot recollect it i _do_ remember now being with you and seeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five minutes however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having no recollection of it that i never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side i never had the smallest idea of it pray undeceive him as soon as you can and tell him i beg his pardon that is i do not know what i ought to say but make him understand what i mean in the properest way i would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours isabella i am sure but you know very well that if i could think of one man more than another _he_ is not the person isabella was silent my dear friend you must not be angry with me i cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me and you know we shall still be sisters yes yes with a blush there are more ways than one of our being sisters but where am i wandering to well my dear catherine the case seems to be that you are determined against poor john is not it so i certainly cannot return his affection and as certainly never meant to encourage it since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have but i confess as soon as i read his letter i thought it a very foolish imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either for what were you to live upon supposing you came together you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money i only wonder john could think of it he could not have received my last you _do_ acquit me then of anything wrong you are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment oh as to that answered isabella laughingly i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been all that is best known to yourself a little harmless flirtation or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by but you may be assured that i am the last person in the world to judge you severely all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits what one means one day you know one may not mean the next circumstances change opinions alter but my opinion of your brother never did alter it was always the same you are describing what never happened my dearest catherine continued the other without at all listening to her i would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about i do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother because he is my brother and who perhaps after all you know might be just as happy without you for people seldom know what they would be at young men especially they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant what i say is why should a brother s happiness be dearer to me than a friend s you know i carry my notions of friendship pretty high but above all things my dear catherine do not be in a hurry take my word for it that if you are in too great a hurry you will certainly live to repent it tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections and i believe he is very right ah here he comes never mind he will not see us i am sure catherine looking up perceived captain tilney and isabella earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke soon caught his notice he approached immediately and took the seat to which her movements invited him his first address made catherine start though spoken low she could distinguish what always to be watched in person or by proxy psha nonsense was isabella s answer in the same half whisper why do you put such things into my head if i could believe it my spirit you know is pretty independent i wish your heart were independent that would be enough for me my heart indeed what can you have to do with hearts you men have none of you any hearts if we have not hearts we have eyes and they give us torment enough do they i am sorry for it i am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me i will look another way i hope this pleases you turning her back on him i hope your eyes are not tormented now never more so for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view at once too much and too little catherine heard all this and quite out of countenance could listen no longer amazed that isabella could endure it and jealous for her brother she rose up and saying she should join mrs allen proposed their walking but for this isabella showed no inclination she was so amazingly tired and it was so odious to parade about the pump room and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters she was expecting her sisters every moment so that her dearest catherine must excuse her and must sit quietly down again but catherine could be stubborn too and mrs allen just then coming up to propose their returning home she joined her and walked out of the pump room leaving isabella still sitting with captain tilney with much uneasiness did she thus leave them it seemed to her that captain tilney was falling in love with isabella and isabella unconsciously encouraging him unconsciously it must be for isabella s attachment to james was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement to doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible and yet during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd she wished isabella had talked more like her usual self and not so much about money and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of captain tilney how strange that she should not perceive his admiration catherine longed to give her a hint of it to put her on her guard and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother the compliment of john thorpe s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister she was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere for she had not forgotten that he could mistake and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious in vanity therefore she gained but little her chief profit was in wonder that he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment isabella talked of his attentions _she_ had never been sensible of any but isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste and would never be said again and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort chapter 19 a few days passed away and catherine though not allowing herself to suspect her friend could not help watching her closely the result of her observations was not agreeable isabella seemed an altered creature when she saw her indeed surrounded only by their immediate friends in edgar s buildings or pulteney street her change of manners was so trifling that had it gone no farther it might have passed unnoticed a something of languid indifference or of that boasted absence of mind which catherine had never heard of before would occasionally come across her but had nothing worse appeared _that_ might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest but when catherine saw her in public admitting captain tilney s attentions as readily as they were offered and allowing him almost an equal share with james in her notice and smiles the alteration became too positive to be passed over what could be meant by such unsteady conduct what her friend could be at was beyond her comprehension isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which catherine could not but resent james was the sufferer she saw him grave and uneasy and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart to _her_ it was always an object for poor captain tilney too she was greatly concerned though his looks did not please her his name was a passport to her goodwill and she thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment for in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump room his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of isabella s engagement that she could not upon reflection imagine him aware of it he might be jealous of her brother as a rival but if more had seemed implied the fault must have been in her misapprehension she wished by a gentle remonstrance to remind isabella of her situation and make her aware of this double unkindness but for remonstrance either opportunity or comprehension was always against her if able to suggest a hint isabella could never understand it in this distress the intended departure of the tilney family became her chief consolation their journey into gloucestershire was to take place within a few days and captain tilney s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own but captain tilney had at present no intention of removing he was not to be of the party to northanger he was to continue at bath when catherine knew this her resolution was directly made she spoke to henry tilney on the subject regretting his brother s evident partiality for miss thorpe and entreating him to make known her prior engagement my brother does know it was henry s answer does he then why does he stay here he made no reply and was beginning to talk of something else but she eagerly continued why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable henry smiled and said i am sure my brother would not wish to do that then you will persuade him to go away persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master no he does not know what he is about cried catherine he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable and are you sure it is my brother s doing yes very sure is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain is not it the same thing i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment catherine blushed for her friend and said isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little after a short pause catherine resumed with then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother i can have no opinion on that subject but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour you are a very close questioner am i i only ask what i want to be told but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at well well nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture is pitiful the premises are before you my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her well said catherine after some moments consideration _you_ may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go my dear miss morland said henry in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave he added though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month catherine would contend no longer against comfort she had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech but it now carried her captive henry tilney must know best she blamed herself for the extent of her fears and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again her resolution was supported by isabella s behaviour in their parting interview the thorpes spent the last evening of catherine s stay in pulteney street and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness or make her quit them in apprehension james was in excellent spirits and isabella most engagingly placid her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart but that at such a moment was allowable and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction and once she drew back her hand but catherine remembered henry s instructions and placed it all to judicious affection the embraces tears and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied chapter 20 mr and mrs allen were sorry to lose their young friend whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased her happiness in going with miss tilney however prevented their wishing it otherwise and as they were to remain only one more week in bath themselves her quitting them now would not long be felt mr allen attended her to milsom street where she was to breakfast and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right and of not being able to preserve their good opinion that in the embarrassment of the first five minutes she could almost have wished to return with him to pulteney street miss tilney s manners and henry s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings but still she was far from being at ease nor could the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure her nay perverse as it seemed she doubted whether she might not have felt less had she been less attended to his anxiety for her comfort his continual solicitations that she would eat and his often expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast table made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor she felt utterly unworthy of such respect and knew not how to reply to it her tranquillity was not improved by the general s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when captain tilney at last came down she was quite pained by the severity of his father s reproof which seemed disproportionate to the offence and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her this was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation and she felt great compassion for captain tilney without being able to hope for his goodwill he listened to his father in silence and attempted not any defence which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind on isabella s account might by keeping him long sleepless have been the real cause of his rising late it was the first time of her being decidedly in his company and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room and even afterwards so much were his spirits affected she could distinguish nothing but these words in a whisper to eleanor how glad i shall be when you are all off the bustle of going was not pleasant the clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down and the general had fixed to be out of milsom street by that hour his greatcoat instead of being brought for him to put on directly was spread out in the curricle in which he was to accompany his son the middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out though there were three people to go in it and his daughter s maid had so crowded it with parcels that miss morland would not have room to sit and so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing desk from being thrown out into the street at last however the door was closed upon the three females and they set off at the sober pace in which the handsome highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles such was the distance of northanger from bath to be now divided into two equal stages catherine s spirits revived as they drove from the door for with miss tilney she felt no restraint and with the interest of a road entirely new to her of an abbey before and a curricle behind she caught the last view of bath without any regret and met with every milestone before she expected it the tediousness of a two hours wait at petty france in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry and loiter about without anything to see next followed and her admiration of the style in which they travelled of the fashionable chaise and four postilions handsomely liveried rising so regularly in their stirrups and numerous outriders properly mounted sunk a little under this consequent inconvenience had their party been perfectly agreeable the delay would have been nothing but general tilney though so charming a man seemed always a check upon his children s spirits and scarcely anything was said but by himself the observation of which with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded and his angry impatience at the waiters made catherine grow every moment more in awe of him and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four at last however the order of release was given and much was catherine then surprised by the general s proposal of her taking his place in his son s curricle for the rest of the journey the day was fine and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible the remembrance of mr allen s opinion respecting young men s open carriages made her blush at the mention of such a plan and her first thought was to decline it but her second was of greater deference for general tilney s judgment he could not propose anything improper for her and in the course of a few minutes she found herself with henry in the curricle as happy a being as ever existed a very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur to be sure but it was a heavy and troublesome business and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at petty france half the time would have been enough for the curricle and so nimbly were the light horses disposed to move that had not the general chosen to have his own carriage lead the way they could have passed it with ease in half a minute but the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses henry drove so well so quietly without making any disturbance without parading to her or swearing at them so different from the only gentleman coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with and then his hat sat so well and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat looked so becomingly important to be driven by him next to being dancing with him was certainly the greatest happiness in the world in addition to every other delight she had now that of listening to her own praise of being thanked at least on his sister s account for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor of hearing it ranked as real friendship and described as creating real gratitude his sister he said was uncomfortably circumstanced she had no female companion and in the frequent absence of her father was sometimes without any companion at all but how can that be said catherine are not you with her northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there how sorry you must be for that i am always sorry to leave eleanor yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable he smiled and said you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you oh but this will not happen to me i am sure how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your _unconquerable_ horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the _third_ night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness oh no no do not say so well go on but henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of matilda s woes catherine recollecting herself grew ashamed of her eagerness and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related miss tilney she was sure would never put her into such a chamber as he had described she was not at all afraid as they drew near the end of their journey her impatience for a sight of the abbey for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different returned in full force and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high gothic windows but so low did the building stand that she found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of northanger without having discerned even an antique chimney she knew not that she had any right to be surprised but there was a something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected to pass between lodges of a modern appearance to find herself with such ease in the very precincts of the abbey and driven so rapidly along a smooth level road of fine gravel without obstacle alarm or solemnity of any kind struck her as odd and inconsistent she was not long at leisure however for such considerations a sudden scud of rain driving full in her face made it impossible for her to observe anything further and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet and she was actually under the abbey walls was springing with henry s assistance from the carriage was beneath the shelter of the old porch and had even passed on to the hall where her friend and the general were waiting to welcome her without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to herself or one moment s suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice the breeze had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her it had wafted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain and having given a good shake to her habit she was ready to be shown into the common drawing room and capable of considering where she was an abbey yes it was delightful to be really in an abbey but she doubted as she looked round the room whether anything within her observation would have given her the consciousness the furniture was in all the profusion and elegance of modern taste the fireplace where she had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times was contracted to a rumford with slabs of plain though handsome marble and ornaments over it of the prettiest english china the windows to which she looked with peculiar dependence from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in their gothic form with reverential care were yet less what her fancy had portrayed to be sure the pointed arch was preserved the form of them was gothic they might be even casements but every pane was so large so clear so light to an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions and the heaviest stone work for painted glass dirt and cobwebs the difference was very distressing the general perceiving how her eye was employed began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture where everything being for daily use pretended only to comfort etc flattering himself however that there were some apartments in the abbey not unworthy her notice and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular when taking out his watch he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five this seemed the word of separation and catherine found herself hurried away by miss tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctuality to the family hours would be expected at northanger returning through the large and lofty hall they ascended a broad staircase of shining oak which after many flights and many landing places brought them upon a long wide gallery on one side it had a range of doors and it was lighted on the other by windows which catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle before miss tilney led the way into a chamber and scarcely staying to hope she would find it comfortable left her with an anxious entreaty that she would make as little alteration as possible in her dress chapter 21 a moment s glance was enough to satisfy catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of it was by no means unreasonably large and contained neither tapestry nor velvet the walls were papered the floor was carpeted the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those of the drawing room below the furniture though not of the latest fashion was handsome and comfortable and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful her heart instantaneously at ease on this point she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything as she greatly dreaded disobliging the general by any delay her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste and she was preparing to unpin the linen package which the chaise seat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation when her eye suddenly fell on a large high chest standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace the sight of it made her start and forgetting everything else she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder while these thoughts crossed her this is strange indeed i did not expect such a sight as this an immense heavy chest what can it hold why should it be placed here pushed back too as if meant to be out of sight i will look into it cost me what it may i will look into it and directly too by daylight if i stay till evening my candle may go out she advanced and examined it closely it was of cedar curiously inlaid with some darker wood and raised about a foot from the ground on a carved stand of the same the lock was silver though tarnished from age at each end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver broken perhaps prematurely by some strange violence and on the centre of the lid was a mysterious cipher in the same metal catherine bent over it intently but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty she could not in whatever direction she took it believe the last letter to be a _t _ and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment if not originally theirs by what strange events could it have fallen into the tilney family her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater and seizing with trembling hands the hasp of the lock she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its contents with difficulty for something seemed to resist her efforts she raised the lid a few inches but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her starting quit her hold and the lid closed with alarming violence this ill timed intruder was miss tilney s maid sent by her mistress to be of use to miss morland and though catherine immediately dismissed her it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing and forced her in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery to proceed in her dressing without further delay her progress was not quick for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt she could not remain many paces from the chest at length however having slipped one arm into her gown her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged one moment surely might be spared and so desperate should be the exertion of her strength that unless secured by supernatural means the lid in one moment should be thrown back with this spirit she sprang forward and her confidence did not deceive her her resolute effort threw back the lid and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane properly folded reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession she was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when miss tilney anxious for her friend s being ready entered the room and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search that is a curious old chest is not it said miss tilney as catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets the worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open in that corner however it is at least out of the way catherine had no leisure for speech being at once blushing tying her gown and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch miss tilney gently hinted her fear of being late and in half a minute they ran downstairs together in an alarm not wholly unfounded for general tilney was pacing the drawing room his watch in his hand and having on the very instant of their entering pulled the bell with violence ordered dinner to be on table _directly _ catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke and sat pale and breathless in a most humble mood concerned for his children and detesting old chests and the general recovering his politeness as he looked at her spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend who was absolutely out of breath from haste when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world but catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself till they were happily seated at the dinner table when the general s complacent smiles and a good appetite of her own restored her to peace the dining parlour was a noble room suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing room than the one in common use and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of catherine who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants of the former she spoke aloud her admiration and the general with a very gracious countenance acknowledged that it was by no means an ill sized room and further confessed that though as careless on such subjects as most people he did look upon a tolerably large eating room as one of the necessaries of life he supposed however that she must have been used to much better sized apartments at mr allen s no indeed was catherine s honest assurance mr allen s dining parlour was not more than half as large and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life the general s good humour increased why as he _had_ such rooms he thought it would be simple not to make use of them but upon his honour he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size mr allen s house he was sure must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness the evening passed without any further disturbance and in the occasional absence of general tilney with much positive cheerfulness it was only in his presence that catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey and even then even in moments of languor or restraint a sense of general happiness preponderated and she could think of her friends in bath without one wish of being with them the night was stormy the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon and by the time the party broke up it blew and rained violently catherine as she crossed the hall listened to the tempest with sensations of awe and when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey yes these were characteristic sounds they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes which such buildings had witnessed and such storms ushered in and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn _she_ had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning in a house so furnished and so guarded she could have nothing to explore or to suffer and might go to her bedroom as securely as if it had been her own chamber at fullerton thus wisely fortifying her mind as she proceeded upstairs she was enabled especially on perceiving that miss tilney slept only two doors from her to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire how much better is this said she as she walked to the fender how much better to find a fire ready lit than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed as so many poor girls have been obliged to do and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot how glad i am that northanger is what it is if it had been like some other places i do not know that in such a night as this i could have answered for my courage but now to be sure there is nothing to alarm one she looked round the room the window curtains seemed in motion it could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the divisions of the shutters and she stepped boldly forward carelessly humming a tune to assure herself of its being so peeped courageously behind each curtain saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her and on placing a hand against the shutter felt the strongest conviction of the wind s force a glance at the old chest as she turned away from this examination was not without its use she scorned the causeless fears of an idle fancy and began with a most happy indifference to prepare herself for bed she should take her time she should not hurry herself she did not care if she were the last person up in the house but she would not make up her fire _that_ would seem cowardly as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed the fire therefore died away and catherine having spent the best part of an hour in her arrangements was beginning to think of stepping into bed when on giving a parting glance round the room she was struck by the appearance of a high old fashioned black cabinet which though in a situation conspicuous enough had never caught her notice before henry s words his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first immediately rushed across her and though there could be nothing really in it there was something whimsical it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence she took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet it was not absolutely ebony and gold but it was japan black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind and as she held her candle the yellow had very much the effect of gold the key was in the door and she had a strange fancy to look into it not however with the smallest expectation of finding anything but it was so very odd after what henry had said in short she could not sleep till she had examined it so placing the candle with great caution on a chair she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn it but it resisted her utmost strength alarmed but not discouraged she tried it another way a bolt flew and she believed herself successful but how strangely mysterious the door was still immovable she paused a moment in breathless wonder the wind roared down the chimney the rain beat in torrents against the windows and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation to retire to bed however unsatisfied on such a point would be vain since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity again therefore she applied herself to the key and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope s last effort the door suddenly yielded to her hand her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory and having thrown open each folding door the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual a double range of small drawers appeared in view with some larger drawers above and below them and in the centre a small door closed also with a lock and key secured in all probability a cavity of importance catherine s heart beat quick but her courage did not fail her with a cheek flushed by hope and an eye straining with curiosity her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth it was entirely empty with less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second a third a fourth each was equally empty not one was left unsearched and in not one was anything found well read in the art of concealing a treasure the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain the place in the middle alone remained now unexplored and though she had never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it it was some time however before she could unfasten the door the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer but at length it did open and not vain as hitherto was her search her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity apparently for concealment and her feelings at that moment were indescribable her heart fluttered her knees trembled and her cheeks grew pale she seized with an unsteady hand the precious manuscript for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what henry had foretold resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest the dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm but there was no danger of its sudden extinction it had yet some hours to burn and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion she hastily snuffed it alas it was snuffed and extinguished in one a lamp could not have expired with more awful effect catherine for a few moments was motionless with horror it was done completely not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room a violent gust of wind rising with sudden fury added fresh horror to the moment catherine trembled from head to foot in the pause which succeeded a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear human nature could support no more a cold sweat stood on her forehead the manuscript fell from her hand and groping her way to the bed she jumped hastily in and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes to close her eyes in sleep that night she felt must be entirely out of the question with a curiosity so justly awakened and feelings in every way so agitated repose must be absolutely impossible the storm too abroad so dreadful she had not been used to feel alarm from wind but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence the manuscript so wonderfully found so wonderfully accomplishing the morning s prediction how was it to be accounted for what could it contain to whom could it relate by what means could it have been so long concealed and how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it till she had made herself mistress of its contents however she could have neither repose nor comfort and with the sun s first rays she was determined to peruse it but many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene she shuddered tossed about in her bed and envied every quiet sleeper the storm still raged and various were the noises more terrific even than the wind which struck at intervals on her startled ear the very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion and at another the lock of her door was agitated as if by the attempt of somebody to enter hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans hour after hour passed away and the wearied catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep chapter 22 the housemaid s folding back her window shutters at eight o clock the next day was the sound which first roused catherine and she opened her eyes wondering that they could ever have been closed on objects of cheerfulness her fire was already burning and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night instantaneously with the consciousness of existence returned her recollection of the manuscript and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid s going away she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow she now plainly saw that she must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had shuddered over in books for the roll seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets was altogether but of trifling size and much less than she had supposed it to be at first her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page she started at its import could it be possible or did not her senses play her false an inventory of linen in coarse and modern characters seemed all that was before her if the evidence of sight might be trusted she held a washing bill in her hand she seized another sheet and saw the same articles with little variation a third a fourth and a fifth presented nothing new shirts stockings cravats and waistcoats faced her in each two others penned by the same hand marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting in letters hair powder shoe string and breeches ball and the larger sheet which had enclosed the rest seemed by its first cramp line to poultice chestnut mare a farrier s bill such was the collection of papers left perhaps as she could then suppose by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them which had filled her with expectation and alarm and robbed her of half her night s rest she felt humbled to the dust could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom a corner of it catching her eye as she lay seemed to rise up in judgment against her nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies to suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that so modern so habitable or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet the key of which was open to all how could she have so imposed on herself heaven forbid that henry tilney should ever know her folly and it was in a great measure his own doing for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it this was the only comfort that occurred impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly those detestable papers then scattered over the bed she rose directly and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before returned them to the same spot within the cabinet with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again to disgrace her even with herself why the locks should have been so difficult to open however was still something remarkable for she could now manage them with perfect ease in this there was surely something mysterious and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute till the possibility of the door s having been at first unlocked and of being herself its fastener darted into her head and cost her another blush she got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections and found her way with all speed to the breakfast parlour as it had been pointed out to her by miss tilney the evening before henry was alone in it and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited was rather distressing for the world would she not have her weakness suspected and yet unequal to an absolute falsehood was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little but we have a charming morning after it she added desiring to get rid of the subject and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over what beautiful hyacinths i have just learnt to love a hyacinth and how might you learn by accident or argument your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the general whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure the elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on catherine s notice when they were seated at table and luckily it had been the general s choice he was enchanted by her approbation of his taste confessed it to be neat and simple thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country and for his part to his uncritical palate the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of staffordshire as from that of dresden or sêve but this was quite an old set purchased two years ago the manufacture was much improved since that time he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind might have been tempted to order a new set he trusted however that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one though not for himself catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him shortly after breakfast henry left them for woodston where business required and would keep him two or three days they all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse and immediately on re entering the breakfast room catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure this is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother s fortitude observed the general to eleanor woodston will make but a sombre appearance to day is it a pretty place asked catherine what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession the imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes the silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house and he now offered himself as her conductor and though catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself under any circumstances not to be gladly accepted for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey and had seen only a few of its rooms the netting box just leisurely drawn forth was closed with joyful haste and she was ready to attend him in a moment and when they had gone over the house he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden she curtsied her acquiescence but perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object the weather was at present favourable and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so which would she prefer he was equally at her service which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend s wishes but he thought he could discern yes he certainly read in miss morland s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather but when did she judge amiss the abbey would be always safe and dry he yielded implicitly and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment he left the room and catherine with a disappointed anxious face began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination under a mistaken idea of pleasing her but she was stopped by miss tilney s saying with a little confusion i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood why was miss tilney embarrassed could there be any unwillingness on the general s side to show her over the abbey the proposal was his own and was not it odd that he should _always_ take his walk so early neither her father nor mr allen did so it was certainly very provoking she was all impatience to see the house and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds if henry had been with them indeed but now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it such were her thoughts but she kept them to herself and put on her bonnet in patient discontent she was struck however beyond her expectation by the grandeur of the abbey as she saw it for the first time from the lawn the whole building enclosed a large court and two sides of the quadrangle rich in gothic ornaments stood forward for admiration the remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees or luxuriant plantations and the steep woody hills rising behind to give it shelter were beautiful even in the leafless month of march catherine had seen nothing to compare with it and her feelings of delight were so strong that without waiting for any better authority she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise the general listened with assenting gratitude and it seemed as if his own estimation of northanger had waited unfixed till that hour the kitchen garden was to be next admired and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park the number of acres contained in this garden was such as catherine could not listen to without dismay being more than double the extent of all mr allen s as well as her father s including church yard and orchard the walls seemed countless in number endless in length a village of hot houses seemed to arise among them and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure the general was flattered by her looks of surprise which told him almost as plainly as he soon forced her to tell him in words that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before and he then modestly owned that without any ambition of that sort himself without any solicitude about it he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom if he had a hobby horse it was _that_ he loved a garden though careless enough in most matters of eating he loved good fruit or if he did not his friends and children did there were great vexations however attending such a garden as his the utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits the pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year mr allen he supposed must feel these inconveniences as well as himself no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it with a triumphant smile of self satisfaction the general wished he could do the same for he never entered his without being vexed in some way or other by its falling short of his plan how were mr allen s succession houses worked describing the nature of his own as they entered them mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then he is a happy man said the general with a look of very happy contempt having taken her into every division and led her under every wall till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea house proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk if miss morland were not tired but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park this is so favourite a walk of mine said miss tilney that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp it was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old scotch firs and catherine struck by its gloomy aspect and eager to enter it could not even by the general s disapprobation be kept from stepping forward he perceived her inclination and having again urged the plea of health in vain was too polite to make further opposition he excused himself however from attending them the rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him and he would meet them by another course he turned away and catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation the shock however being less real than the relief offered it no injury and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired i am particularly fond of this spot said her companion with a sigh it was my mother s favourite walk catherine had never heard mrs tilney mentioned in the family before and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more i used to walk here so often with her added eleanor though i never loved it then as i have loved it since at that time indeed i used to wonder at her choice but her memory endears it now and ought it not reflected catherine to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it miss tilney continuing silent she ventured to say her death must have been a great affliction a great and increasing one replied the other in a low voice i was only thirteen when it happened and though i felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it i did not i could not then know what a loss it was she stopped for a moment and then added with great firmness i have no sister you know and though henry though my brothers are very affectionate and henry is a great deal here which i am most thankful for it is impossible for me not to be often solitary to be sure you must miss him very much a mother would have been always present a mother would have been a constant friend her influence would have been beyond all other was she a very charming woman was she handsome was there any picture of her in the abbey and why had she been so partial to that grove was it from dejection of spirits were questions now eagerly poured forth the first three received a ready affirmative the two others were passed by and catherine s interest in the deceased mrs tilney augmented with every question whether answered or not of her unhappiness in marriage she felt persuaded the general certainly had been an unkind husband he did not love her walk could he therefore have loved her and besides handsome as he was there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her her picture i suppose blushing at the consummate art of her own question hangs in your father s room no it was intended for the drawing room but my father was dissatisfied with the painting and for some time it had no place soon after her death i obtained it for my own and hung it in my bed chamber where i shall be happy to show it you it is very like here was another proof a portrait very like of a departed wife not valued by the husband he must have been dreadfully cruel to her catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which in spite of all his attentions he had previously excited and what had been terror and dislike before was now absolute aversion yes aversion his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her she had often read of such characters characters which mr allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn but here was proof positive of the contrary she had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the general and in spite of all her virtuous indignation she found herself again obliged to walk with him listen to him and even to smile when he smiled being no longer able however to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects she soon began to walk with lassitude the general perceived it and with a concern for her health which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house he would follow them in a quarter of an hour again they parted but eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return this second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck catherine as very remarkable chapter 23 an hour passed away before the general came in spent on the part of his young guest in no very favourable consideration of his character this lengthened absence these solitary rambles did not speak a mind at ease or a conscience void of reproach at length he appeared and whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations he could still smile with _them_ miss tilney understanding in part her friend s curiosity to see the house soon revived the subject and her father being contrary to catherine s expectations unprovided with any pretence for further delay beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return was at last ready to escort them they set forward and with a grandeur of air a dignified step which caught the eye but could not shake the doubts of the well read catherine he led the way across the hall through the common drawing room and one useless antechamber into a room magnificent both in size and furniture the real drawing room used only with company of consequence it was very noble very grand very charming was all that catherine had to say for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin and all minuteness of praise all praise that had much meaning was supplied by the general the costliness or elegance of any room s fitting up could be nothing to her she cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century when the general had satisfied his own curiosity in a close examination of every well known ornament they proceeded into the library an apartment in its way of equal magnificence exhibiting a collection of books on which an humble man might have looked with pride catherine heard admired and wondered with more genuine feeling than before gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge by running over the titles of half a shelf and was ready to proceed but suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes large as was the building she had already visited the greatest part though on being told that with the addition of the kitchen the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court she could scarcely believe it or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted it was some relief however that they were to return to the rooms in common use by passing through a few of less importance looking into the court which with occasional passages not wholly unintricate connected the different sides and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister having traces of cells pointed out and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her by finding herself successively in a billiard room and in the general s private apartment without comprehending their connection or being able to turn aright when she left them and lastly by passing through a dark little room owning henry s authority and strewed with his litter of books guns and greatcoats from the dining room of which though already seen and always to be seen at five o clock the general could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length for the more certain information of miss morland as to what she neither doubted nor cared for they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen the ancient kitchen of the convent rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days and in the stoves and hot closets of the present the general s improving hand had not loitered here every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this their spacious theatre and when the genius of others had failed his own had often produced the perfection wanted his endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent with the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey the fourth side of the quadrangle having on account of its decaying state been removed by the general s father and the present erected in its place all that was venerable ceased here the new building was not only new but declared itself to be so intended only for offices and enclosed behind by stable yards no uniformity of architecture had been thought necessary catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest for the purposes of mere domestic economy and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen had the general allowed it but if he had a vanity it was in the arrangement of his offices and as he was convinced that to a mind like miss morland s a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened must always be gratifying he should make no apology for leading her on they took a slight survey of all and catherine was impressed beyond her expectation by their multiplicity and their convenience the purposes for which a few shapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at fullerton were here carried on in appropriate divisions commodious and roomy the number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices wherever they went some pattened girl stopped to curtsy or some footman in dishabille sneaked off yet this was an abbey how inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about from abbeys and castles in which though certainly larger than northanger all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost how they could get through it all had often amazed mrs allen and when catherine saw what was necessary here she began to be amazed herself they returned to the hall that the chief staircase might be ascended and the beauty of its wood and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out having gained the top they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which her room lay and shortly entered one on the same plan but superior in length and breadth she was here shown successively into three large bed chambers with their dressing rooms most completely and handsomely fitted up everything that money and taste could do to give comfort and elegance to apartments had been bestowed on these and being furnished within the last five years they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing and wanting in all that could give pleasure to catherine as they were surveying the last the general after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured turned with a smiling countenance to catherine and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be our friends from fullerton she felt the unexpected compliment and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself and so full of civility to all her family the gallery was terminated by folding doors which miss tilney advancing had thrown open and passed through and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left in another long reach of gallery when the general coming forwards called her hastily and as catherine thought rather angrily back demanding whither she were going and what was there more to be seen had not miss morland already seen all that could be worth her notice and did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise miss tilney drew back directly and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified catherine who having seen in a momentary glance beyond them a narrower passage more numerous openings and symptoms of a winding staircase believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice and felt as she unwillingly paced back the gallery that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest the general s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant something was certainly to be concealed her fancy though it had trespassed lately once or twice could not mislead her here and what that something was a short sentence of miss tilney s as they followed the general at some distance downstairs seemed to point out i was going to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died were all her words but few as they were they conveyed pages of intelligence to catherine it was no wonder that the general should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed which released his suffering wife and left him to the stings of conscience she ventured when next alone with eleanor to express her wish of being permitted to see it as well as all the rest of that side of the house and eleanor promised to attend her there whenever they should have a convenient hour catherine understood her the general must be watched from home before that room could be entered it remains as it was i suppose said she in a tone of feeling yes entirely and how long ago may it be that your mother died she has been dead these nine years and nine years catherine knew was a trifle of time compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife before her room was put to rights you were with her i suppose to the last no said miss tilney sighing i was unfortunately from home her illness was sudden and short and before i arrived it was all over catherine s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words could it be possible could henry s father and yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions and when she saw him in the evening while she worked with her friend slowly pacing the drawing room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness with downcast eyes and contracted brow she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him it was the air and attitude of a montoni what could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity in its fearful review of past scenes of guilt unhappy man and the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly as to catch miss tilney s notice my father she whispered often walks about the room in this way it is nothing unusual so much the worse thought catherine such ill timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks and boded nothing good after an evening the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of henry s importance among them she was heartily glad to be dismissed though it was a look from the general not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell when the butler would have lit his master s candle however he was forbidden the latter was not going to retire i have many pamphlets to finish said he to catherine before i can close my eyes and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep can either of us be more meetly employed _my_ eyes will be blinding for the good of others and _yours_ preparing by rest for future mischief but neither the business alleged nor the magnificent compliment could win catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose to be kept up for hours after the family were in bed by stupid pamphlets was not very likely there must be some deeper cause something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept and the probability that mrs tilney yet lived shut up for causes unknown and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food was the conclusion which necessarily followed shocking as was the idea it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened as in the natural course of things she must ere long be released the suddenness of her reputed illness the absence of her daughter and probably of her other children at the time all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment its origin jealousy perhaps or wanton cruelty was yet to be unravelled in revolving these matters while she undressed it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman s confinement might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division in the high arched passage paved with stone which already she had trodden with peculiar awe she well remembered the doors of which the general had given no account to what might not those doors lead in support of the plausibility of this conjecture it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate mrs tilney must be as certainly as her memory could guide her exactly over this suspected range of cells and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse communicating by some secret means with those cells might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well prepared insensibility catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible the side of the quadrangle in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting being according to her belief just opposite her own it struck her that if judiciously watched some rays of light from the general s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows as he passed to the prison of his wife and twice before she stepped into bed she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery to see if it appeared but all abroad was dark and it must yet be too early the various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up till midnight she supposed it would be in vain to watch but then when the clock had struck twelve and all was quiet she would if not quite appalled by darkness steal out and look once more the clock struck twelve and catherine had been half an hour asleep chapter 24 the next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments it was sunday and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home and great as was catherine s curiosity her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o clock or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp the day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of mrs tilney which immediately fronted the family pew by that her eye was instantly caught and long retained and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband who must have been in some way or other her destroyer affected her even to tears that the general having erected such a monument should be able to face it was not perhaps very strange and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view maintain so elevated an air look so fearlessly around nay that he should even enter the church seemed wonderful to catherine not however that many instances of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced she could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice going on from crime to crime murdering whomsoever they chose without any feeling of humanity or remorse till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career the erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of mrs tilney s actual decease were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed what could it avail in such a case catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced and a supposititious funeral carried on the succeeding morning promised something better the general s early walk ill timed as it was in every other view was favourable here and when she knew him to be out of the house she directly proposed to miss tilney the accomplishment of her promise eleanor was ready to oblige her and catherine reminding her as they went of another promise their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed chamber it represented a very lovely woman with a mild and pensive countenance justifying so far the expectations of its new observer but they were not in every respect answered for catherine had depended upon meeting with features hair complexion that should be the very counterpart the very image if not of henry s of eleanor s the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child a face once taken was taken for generations but here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness she contemplated it however in spite of this drawback with much emotion and but for a yet stronger interest would have left it unwillingly her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse she could only look at her companion eleanor s countenance was dejected yet sedate and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing again she passed through the folding doors again her hand was upon the important lock and catherine hardly able to breathe was turning to close the former with fearful caution when the figure the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery stood before her the name of eleanor at the same moment in his loudest tone resounded through the building giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence and to catherine terror upon terror an attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye and when her friend who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her had joined and disappeared with him she ran for safety to her own room and locking herself in believed that she should never have courage to go down again she remained there at least an hour in the greatest agitation deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend and expecting a summons herself from the angry general to attend him in his own apartment no summons however arrived and at last on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors the breakfast room was gay with company and she was named to them by the general as the friend of his daughter in a complimentary style which so well concealed his resentful ire as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present and eleanor with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character taking an early occasion of saying to her my father only wanted me to answer a note she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the general or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence after the company left them and nothing occurred to disturb it in the course of this morning s reflections she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone it would be much better in every respect that eleanor should know nothing of the matter to involve her in the danger of a second detection to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart could not be the office of a friend the general s utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter and besides she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion it would be impossible to explain to eleanor the suspicions from which the other had in all likelihood been hitherto happily exempt nor could she therefore in _her_ presence search for those proofs of the general s cruelty which however they might yet have escaped discovery she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth in the shape of some fragmented journal continued to the last gasp of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress and as she wished to get it over before henry s return who was expected on the morrow there was no time to be lost the day was bright her courage high at four o clock the sun was now two hours above the horizon and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual it was done and catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike it was no time for thought she hurried on slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors and without stopping to look or breathe rushed forward to the one in question the lock yielded to her hand and luckily with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being on tiptoe she entered the room was before her but it was some minutes before she could advance another step she beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature she saw a large well proportioned apartment an handsome dimity bed arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid s care a bright bath stove mahogany wardrobes and neatly painted chairs on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows catherine had expected to have her feelings worked and worked they were astonishment and doubt first seized them and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame she could not be mistaken as to the room but how grossly mistaken in everything else in miss tilney s meaning in her own calculation this apartment to which she had given a date so ancient a position so awful proved to be one end of what the general s father had built there were two other doors in the chamber leading probably into dressing closets but she had no inclination to open either would the veil in which mrs tilney had last walked or the volume in which she had last read remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper no whatever might have been the general s crimes he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection she was sick of exploring and desired but to be safe in her own room with her own heart only privy to its folly and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered when the sound of footsteps she could hardly tell where made her pause and tremble to be found there even by a servant would be unpleasant but by the general and he seemed always at hand when least wanted much worse she listened the sound had ceased and resolving not to lose a moment she passed through and closed the door at that instant a door underneath was hastily opened someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery she had no power to move with a feeling of terror not very definable she fixed her eyes on the staircase and in a few moments it gave henry to her view mr tilney she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment he looked astonished too good god she continued not attending to his address how came you here how came you up that staircase how came i up that staircase he replied greatly surprised because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it catherine recollected herself blushed deeply and could say no more he seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford she moved on towards the gallery and may i not in my turn said he as he pushed back the folding doors ask how _you_ came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine i have been said catherine looking down to see your mother s room my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till to morrow i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only dropping her voice your father was with us and that prevented you said henry earnestly regarding her have you looked into all the rooms in that passage no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress it is only a quarter past four showing his watch and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough she could not contradict it and therefore suffered herself to be detained though her dread of further questions made her for the first time in their acquaintance wish to leave him they walked slowly up the gallery have you had any letter from bath since i saw you no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose no it has been your own doing entirely catherine said nothing after a short silence during which he had closely observed her he added as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly slowly and with hesitation it was spoken and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her and from these circumstances he replied his quick eye fixed on hers you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some involuntarily she shook her head or it may be of something still less pardonable she raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before my mother s illness he continued the seizure which ended in her death _was_ sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i _we_ were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin but your father said catherine was _he_ afflicted for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death i am very glad of it said catherine it would have been very shocking if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting they had reached the end of the gallery and with tears of shame she ran off to her own room chapter 25 the visions of romance were over catherine was completely awakened henry s address short as it had been had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done most grievously was she humbled most bitterly did she cry it was not only with herself that she was sunk but with henry her folly which now seemed even criminal was all exposed to him and he must despise her forever the liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father could he ever forgive it the absurdity of her curiosity and her fears could they ever be forgotten she hated herself more than she could express he had she thought he had once or twice before this fatal morning shown something like affection for her but now in short she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour went down when the clock struck five with a broken heart and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to eleanor s inquiry if she was well the formidable henry soon followed her into the room and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual catherine had never wanted comfort more and he looked as if he was aware of it the evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity she did not learn either to forget or defend the past but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther and that it might not cost her henry s entire regard her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary self created delusion each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which before she entered the abbey had been craving to be frightened she remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of northanger she saw that the infatuation had been created the mischief settled long before her quitting bath and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged charming as were all mrs radcliffe s works and charming even as were the works of all her imitators it was not in them perhaps that human nature at least in the midland counties of england was to be looked for of the alps and pyrenees with their pine forests and their vices they might give a faithful delineation and italy switzerland and the south of france might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there represented catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country and even of that if hard pressed would have yielded the northern and western extremities but in the central part of england there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved in the laws of the land and the manners of the age murder was not tolerated servants were not slaves and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured like rhubarb from every druggist among the alps and pyrenees perhaps there were no mixed characters there such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend but in england it was not so among the english she believed in their hearts and habits there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad upon this conviction she would not be surprised if even in henry and eleanor tilney some slight imperfection might hereafter appear and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father who though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained she did believe upon serious consideration to be not perfectly amiable her mind made up on these several points and her resolution formed of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day henry s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed was of the greatest assistance to her and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress her spirits became absolutely comfortable and capable as heretofore of continual improvement by anything he said there were still some subjects indeed under which she believed they must always tremble the mention of a chest or a cabinet for instance and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape but even _she_ could allow that an occasional memento of past folly however painful might not be without use the anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance her desire of hearing from isabella grew every day greater she was quite impatient to know how the bath world went on and how the rooms were attended and especially was she anxious to be assured of isabella s having matched some fine netting cotton on which she had left her intent and of her continuing on the best terms with james her only dependence for information of any kind was on isabella james had protested against writing to her till his return to oxford and mrs allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to fullerton but isabella had promised and promised again and when she promised a thing she was so scrupulous in performing it this made it so particularly strange for nine successive mornings catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment which each morning became more severe but on the tenth when she entered the breakfast room her first object was a letter held out by henry s willing hand she thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself tis only from james however as she looked at the direction she opened it it was from oxford and to this purpose dear catherine though god knows with little inclination for writing i think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between miss thorpe and me i left her and bath yesterday never to see either again i shall not enter into particulars they would only pain you more you will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame and i hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned thank god i am undeceived in time but it is a heavy blow after my father s consent had been so kindly given but no more of this she has made me miserable forever let me soon hear from you dear catherine you are my only friend _your_ love i do build upon i wish your visit at northanger may be over before captain tilney makes his engagement known or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced poor thorpe is in town i dread the sight of him his honest heart would feel so much i have written to him and my father her duplicity hurts me more than all till the very last if i reasoned with her she declared herself as much attached to me as ever and laughed at my fears i am ashamed to think how long i bore with it but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved i was that man i cannot understand even now what she would be at for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of tilney we parted at last by mutual consent happy for me had we never met i can never expect to know such another woman dearest catherine beware how you give your heart believe me c catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder declared her to be receiving unpleasant news and henry earnestly watching her through the whole letter saw plainly that it ended no better than it began he was prevented however from even looking his surprise by his father s entrance they went to breakfast directly but catherine could hardly eat anything tears filled her eyes and even ran down her cheeks as she sat the letter was one moment in her hand then in her lap and then in her pocket and she looked as if she knew not what she did the general between his cocoa and his newspaper had luckily no leisure for noticing her but to the other two her distress was equally visible as soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room but the housemaids were busy in it and she was obliged to come down again she turned into the drawing room for privacy but henry and eleanor had likewise retreated thither and were at that moment deep in consultation about her she drew back trying to beg their pardon but was with gentle violence forced to return and the others withdrew after eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her after half an hour s free indulgence of grief and reflection catherine felt equal to encountering her friends but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration perhaps if particularly questioned she might just give an idea just distantly hint at it but not more to expose a friend such a friend as isabella had been to her and then their own brother so closely concerned in it she believed she must waive the subject altogether henry and eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast room and each as she entered it looked at her anxiously catherine took her place at the table and after a short silence eleanor said no bad news from fullerton i hope mr and mrs morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill no i thank you sighing as she spoke they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford nothing further was said for a few minutes and then speaking through her tears she added i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again i am sorry said henry closing the book he had just opened if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister replied henry warmly must be a comfort to him under any distress i have one favour to beg said catherine shortly afterwards in an agitated manner that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away our brother frederick yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney eleanor s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment but henry began to suspect the truth and something in which miss thorpe s name was included passed his lips how quick you are cried catherine you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder _now_ i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part recollecting with a blush the last line will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother no read it yourself cried catherine whose second thoughts were clearer i do not know what i was thinking of blushing again that she had blushed before james only means to give me good advice he gladly received the letter and having read it through with close attention returned it saying well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son miss tilney at catherine s invitation now read the letter likewise and having expressed also her concern and surprise began to inquire into miss thorpe s connections and fortune her mother is a very good sort of woman was catherine s answer what was her father a lawyer i believe they live at putney are they a wealthy family no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children the brother and sister looked at each other but said eleanor after a short pause would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry such a girl she must be an unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange an infatuation on frederick s side a girl who before his eyes is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man is not it inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly who found no woman good enough to be loved that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise such a sister in law henry i should delight in said eleanor with a smile but perhaps observed catherine though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant indeed i am afraid she will replied henry i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before among all the great variety that you have known and studied my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this no said catherine after a few moments reflection i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves catherine by some chance or other found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on though so unaccountably to mention the circumstance which had produced it chapter 26 from this time the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people and catherine found with some surprise that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering isabella s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother their persuasion that the general would upon this ground alone independent of the objection that might be raised against her character oppose the connection turned her feelings moreover with some alarm towards herself she was as insignificant and perhaps as portionless as isabella and if the heir of the tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest the very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality which as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money which she had more than once heard him utter and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children they were so fully convinced however that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person for his father s consent and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to come to northanger than at the present time that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own but as it was not to be supposed that captain tilney whenever he made his application would give his father any just idea of isabella s conduct it occurred to her as highly expedient that henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was enabling the general by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations she proposed it to him accordingly but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected no said he my father s hands need not be strengthened and frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled he must tell his own story but he will tell only half of it a quarter would be enough a day or two passed away and brought no tidings of captain tilney his brother and sister knew not what to think sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it the general meanwhile though offended every morning by frederick s remissness in writing was free from any real anxiety about him and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making miss morland s time at northanger pass pleasantly he often expressed his uneasiness on this head feared the sameness of every day s society and employments would disgust her with the place wished the lady frasers had been in the country talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood but then it was such a dead time of year no wild fowl no game and the lady frasers were not in the country and it all ended at last in his telling henry one morning that when he next went to woodston they would take him by surprise there some day or other and eat their mutton with him henry was greatly honoured and very happy and catherine was quite delighted with the scheme and when do you think sir i may look forward to this pleasure i must be at woodston on monday to attend the parish meeting and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us a ball itself could not have been more welcome to catherine than this little excursion so strong was her desire to be acquainted with woodston and her heart was still bounding with joy when henry about an hour afterwards came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and eleanor were sitting and said i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woodston on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it go away said catherine with a very long face and why why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure oh not seriously aye and sadly too for i had much rather stay but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because _anything_ would do henry only smiled i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as to morrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return he went and it being at any time a much simpler operation to catherine to doubt her own judgment than henry s she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right however disagreeable to her his going but the inexplicability of the general s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts that he was very particular in his eating she had by her own unassisted observation already discovered but why he should say one thing so positively and mean another all the while was most unaccountable how were people at that rate to be understood who but henry could have been aware of what his father was at from saturday to wednesday however they were now to be without henry this was the sad finale of every reflection and captain tilney s letter would certainly come in his absence and wednesday she was very sure would be wet the past present and future were all equally in gloom her brother so unhappy and her loss in isabella so great and eleanor s spirits always affected by henry s absence what was there to interest or amuse her she was tired of the woods and the shrubberies always so smooth and so dry and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house the painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a consideration of the building what a revolution in her ideas she who had so longed to be in an abbey now there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well connected parsonage something like fullerton but better fullerton had its faults but woodston probably had none if wednesday should ever come it did come and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for it came it was fine and catherine trod on air by ten o clock the chaise and four conveyed the trio from the abbey and after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles they entered woodston a large and populous village in a situation not unpleasant catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it as the general seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country and the size of the village but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage and at all the little chandler s shops which they passed at the further end of the village and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it stood the parsonage a new built substantial stone house with its semicircular sweep and green gates and as they drove up to the door henry with the friends of his solitude a large newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers was ready to receive and make much of them catherine s mind was too full as she entered the house for her either to observe or to say a great deal and till called on by the general for her opinion of it she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting upon looking round it then she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world but she was too guarded to say so and the coldness of her praise disappointed him we are not calling it a good house said he we are not comparing it with fullerton and northanger we are considering it as a mere parsonage small and confined we allow but decent perhaps and habitable and altogether not inferior to the generality or in other words i believe there are few country parsonages in england half so good it may admit of improvement however far be it from me to say otherwise and anything in reason a bow thrown out perhaps though between ourselves if there is one thing more than another my aversion it is a patched on bow catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by henry at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant the general was shortly restored to his complacency and catherine to all her usual ease of spirits the room in question was of a commodious well proportioned size and handsomely fitted up as a dining parlour and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds she was shown first into a smaller apartment belonging peculiarly to the master of the house and made unusually tidy on the occasion and afterwards into what was to be the drawing room with the appearance of which though unfurnished catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general it was a prettily shaped room the windows reaching to the ground and the view from them pleasant though only over green meadows and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world i trust said the general with a most satisfied smile that it will very speedily be furnished it waits only for a lady s taste well if it was my house i should never sit anywhere else oh what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees too it is the prettiest cottage you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains such a compliment recalled all catherine s consciousness and silenced her directly and though pointedly applied to by the general for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her the influence of fresh objects and fresh air however was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations and having reached the ornamental part of the premises consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow on which henry s genius had begun to act about half a year ago she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure ground she had ever been in before though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner a saunter into other meadows and through part of the village with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about brought them to four o clock when catherine scarcely thought it could be three at four they were to dine and at six to set off on their return never had any day passed so quickly she could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the general nay that he was even looking at the side table for cold meat which was not there his son and daughter s observations were of a different kind they had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter s being oiled at six o clock the general having taken his coffee the carriage again received them and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations that could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son catherine would have quitted woodston with little anxiety as to the how or the when she might return to it chapter 27 the next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from isabella _bath april_ my dearest catherine i received your two kind letters with the greatest delight and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner i really am quite ashamed of my idleness but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing i have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left bath but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other pray write to me soon and direct to my own home thank god we leave this vile place to morrow since you went away i have had no pleasure in it the dust is beyond anything and everybody one cares for is gone i believe if i could see you i should not mind the rest for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive i am quite uneasy about your dear brother not having heard from him since he went to oxford and am fearful of some misunderstanding your kind offices will set all right he is the only man i ever did or could love and i trust you will convince him of it the spring fashions are partly down and the hats the most frightful you can imagine i hope you spend your time pleasantly but am afraid you never think of me i will not say all that i could of the family you are with because i would not be ungenerous or set you against those you esteem but it is very difficult to know whom to trust and young men never know their minds two days together i rejoice to say that the young man whom of all others i particularly abhor has left bath you will know from this description i must mean captain tilney who as you may remember was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me before you went away afterwards he got worse and became quite my shadow many girls might have been taken in for never were such attentions but i knew the fickle sex too well he went away to his regiment two days ago and i trust i shall never be plagued with him again he is the greatest coxcomb i ever saw and amazingly disagreeable the last two days he was always by the side of charlotte davis i pitied his taste but took no notice of him the last time we met was in bath street and i turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me i would not even look at him he went into the pump room afterwards but i would not have followed him for all the world such a contrast between him and your brother pray send me some news of the latter i am quite unhappy about him he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away with a cold or something that affected his spirits i would write to him myself but have mislaid his direction and as i hinted above am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss pray explain everything to his satisfaction or if he still harbours any doubt a line from himself to me or a call at putney when next in town might set all to rights i have not been to the rooms this age nor to the play except going in last night with the hodges for a frolic at half price they teased me into it and i was determined they should not say i shut myself up because tilney was gone we happened to sit by the mitchells and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out i knew their spite at one time they could not be civil to me but now they are all friendship but i am not such a fool as to be taken in by them you know i have a pretty good spirit of my own anne mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine as i wore it the week before at the concert but made wretched work of it it happened to become my odd face i believe at least tilney told me so at the time and said every eye was upon me but he is the last man whose word i would take i wear nothing but purple now i know i look hideous in it but no matter it is your dear brother s favourite colour lose no time my dearest sweetest catherine in writing to him and to me who ever am etc such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon catherine its inconsistencies contradictions and falsehood struck her from the very first she was ashamed of isabella and ashamed of having ever loved her her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty and her demands impudent write to james on her behalf no james should never hear isabella s name mentioned by her again on henry s arrival from woodston she made known to him and eleanor their brother s safety congratulating them with sincerity on it and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation when she had finished it so much for isabella she cried and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her it will soon be as if you never had said henry there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the _effect_ of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her i am persuaded that he never did and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake henry bowed his assent well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment it is very right that you should stand by your brother and if you would stand by _yours_ you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge catherine was complimented out of further bitterness frederick could not be unpardonably guilty while henry made himself so agreeable she resolved on not answering isabella s letter and tried to think no more of it chapter 28 soon after this the general found himself obliged to go to london for a week and he left northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of miss morland s company and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence his departure gave catherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain the happiness with which their time now passed every employment voluntary every laugh indulged every meal a scene of ease and good humour walking where they liked and when they liked their hours pleasures and fatigues at their own command made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the general s presence had imposed and most thankfully feel their present release from it such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy but she was now in the fourth week of her visit before the general came home the fourth week would be turned and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer this was a painful consideration whenever it occurred and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind she very soon resolved to speak to eleanor about it at once propose going away and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken aware that if she gave herself much time she might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone with eleanor and of eleanor s being in the middle of a speech about something very different to start forth her obligation of going away very soon eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned she had hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time had been misled perhaps by her wishes to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised and could not but think that if mr and mrs morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there they would be too generous to hasten her return catherine explained oh as to _that_ papa and mamma were in no hurry at all as long as she was happy they would always be satisfied then why might she ask in such a hurry herself to leave them oh because she had been there so long nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again and it was directly settled that till she had her leaving them was not even to be thought of in having this cause of uneasiness so pleasantly removed the force of the other was likewise weakened the kindness the earnestness of eleanor s manner in pressing her to stay and henry s gratified look on being told that her stay was determined were such sweet proofs of her importance with them as left her only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without she did almost always believe that henry loved her and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them and believing so far her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations henry was not able to obey his father s injunction of remaining wholly at northanger in attendance on the ladies during his absence in london the engagements of his curate at woodston obliging him to leave them on saturday for a couple of nights his loss was not now what it had been while the general was at home it lessened their gaiety but did not ruin their comfort and the two girls agreeing in occupation and improving in intimacy found themselves so well sufficient for the time to themselves that it was eleven o clock rather a late hour at the abbey before they quitted the supper room on the day of henry s departure they had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge that a carriage was driving up to the door and the next moment confirmed the idea by the loud noise of the house bell after the first perturbation of surprise had passed away in a good heaven what can be the matter it was quickly decided by eleanor to be her eldest brother whose arrival was often as sudden if not quite so unseasonable and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him catherine walked on to her chamber making up her mind as well as she could to a further acquaintance with captain tilney and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful she trusted he would never speak of miss thorpe and indeed as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted there could be no danger of it and as long as all mention of bath scenes were avoided she thought she could behave to him very civilly in such considerations time passed away and it was certainly in his favour that eleanor should be so glad to see him and have so much to say for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival and eleanor did not come up at that moment catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery and listened for its continuance but all was silent scarcely however had she convicted her fancy of error when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it she trembled a little at the idea of anyone s approaching so cautiously but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm or misled by a raised imagination she stepped quietly forward and opened the door eleanor and only eleanor stood there catherine s spirits however were tranquillized but for an instant for eleanor s cheeks were pale and her manner greatly agitated though evidently intending to come in it seemed an effort to enter the room and a still greater to speak when there catherine supposing some uneasiness on captain tilney s account could only express her concern by silent attention obliged her to be seated rubbed her temples with lavender water and hung over her with affectionate solicitude my dear catherine you must not you must not indeed were eleanor s first connected words i am quite well this kindness distracts me i cannot bear it i come to you on such an errand errand to me how shall i tell you oh how shall i tell you a new idea now darted into catherine s mind and turning as pale as her friend she exclaimed tis a messenger from woodston you are mistaken indeed returned eleanor looking at her most compassionately it is no one from woodston it is my father himself her voice faltered and her eyes were turned to the ground as she mentioned his name his unlooked for return was enough in itself to make catherine s heart sink and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told she said nothing and eleanor endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness but with eyes still cast down soon went on you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform i am indeed a most unwilling messenger after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by but i must not trust myself with words my dear catherine we are to part my father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on monday we are going to lord longtown s near hereford for a fortnight explanation and apology are equally impossible i cannot attempt either my dear eleanor cried catherine suppressing her feelings as well as she could do not be so distressed a second engagement must give way to a first i am very very sorry we are to part so soon and so suddenly too but i am not offended indeed i am not i can finish my visit here you know at any time or i hope you will come to me can you when you return from this lord s come to fullerton it will not be in my power catherine come when you can then eleanor made no answer and catherine s thoughts recurring to something more directly interesting she added thinking aloud monday so soon as monday and you _all_ go well i am certain of i shall be able to take leave however i need not go till just before you do you know do not be distressed eleanor i can go on monday very well my father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence the general will send a servant with me i dare say half the way and then i shall soon be at salisbury and then i am only nine miles from home ah catherine were it settled so it would be somewhat less intolerable though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought but how can i tell you to morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice the very carriage is ordered and will be here at seven o clock and no servant will be offered you catherine sat down breathless and speechless i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can be more than i myself but i must not talk of what i felt oh that i could suggest anything in extenuation good god what will your father and mother say after courting you from the protection of real friends to this almost double distance from your home to have you driven out of the house without the considerations even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being the bearer of such a message i seem guilty myself of all its insult yet i trust you will acquit me for you must have been long enough in this house to see that i am but a nominal mistress of it that my real power is nothing have i offended the general said catherine in a faltering voice alas for my feelings as a daughter all that i know all that i answer for is that you can have given him no just cause of offence he certainly is greatly very greatly discomposed i have seldom seen him more so his temper is not happy and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree some disappointment some vexation which just at this moment seems important but which i can hardly suppose you to have any concern in for how is it possible it was with pain that catherine could speak at all and it was only for eleanor s sake that she attempted it i am sure said she i am very sorry if i have offended him it was the last thing i would willingly have done but do not be unhappy eleanor an engagement you know must be kept i am only sorry it was not recollected sooner that i might have written home but it is of very little consequence i hope i earnestly hope that to your real safety it will be of none but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to your family to the world were your friends the allens still in bath you might go to them with comparative ease a few hours would take you there but a journey of seventy miles to be taken post by you at your age alone unattended oh the journey is nothing do not think about that and if we are to part a few hours sooner or later you know makes no difference i can be ready by seven let me be called in time eleanor saw that she wished to be alone and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation now left her with i shall see you in the morning catherine s swelling heart needed relief in eleanor s presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrents turned from the house and in such a way without any reason that could justify any apology that could atone for the abruptness the rudeness nay the insolence of it henry at a distance not able even to bid him farewell every hope every expectation from him suspended at least and who could say how long who could say when they might meet again and all this by such a man as general tilney so polite so well bred and heretofore so particularly fond of her it was as incomprehensible as it was mortifying and grievous from what it could arise and where it would end were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm the manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling of two days the earliest fixed on and of that almost the earliest hour as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning that he might not be obliged even to see her what could all this mean but an intentional affront by some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offend him eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion but catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected or at least not supposed to be connected with it heavily passed the night sleep or repose that deserved the name of sleep was out of the question that room in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then how mournfully superior in reality and substance her anxiety had foundation in fact her fears in probability and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil the solitude of her situation the darkness of her chamber the antiquity of the building were felt and considered without the smallest emotion and though the wind was high and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house she heard it all as she lay awake hour after hour without curiosity or terror soon after six eleanor entered her room eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible but very little remained to be done catherine had not loitered she was almost dressed and her packing almost finished the possibility of some conciliatory message from the general occurred to her as his daughter appeared what so natural as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it and she only wanted to know how far after what had passed an apology might properly be received by her but the knowledge would have been useless here it was not called for neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial eleanor brought no message very little passed between them on meeting each found her greatest safety in silence and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs catherine in busy agitation completing her dress and eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk when everything was done they left the room catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well known cherished object and went down to the breakfast parlour where breakfast was prepared she tried to eat as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable but she had no appetite and could not swallow many mouthfuls the contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery and strengthened her distaste for everything before her it was not four and twenty hours ago since they had met there to the same repast but in circumstances how different with what cheerful ease what happy though false security had she then looked around her enjoying everything present and fearing little in future beyond henry s going to woodston for a day happy happy breakfast for henry had been there henry had sat by her and helped her these reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion who sat as deep in thought as herself and the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the present moment catherine s colour rose at the sight of it and the indignity with which she was treated striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force made her for a short time sensible only of resentment eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech you _must_ write to me catherine she cried you _must_ let me hear from you as soon as possible till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour s comfort for _one_ letter at all risks all hazards i must entreat let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at fullerton and have found your family well and then till i can ask for your correspondence as i ought to do i will not expect more direct to me at lord longtown s and i must ask it under cover to alice no eleanor if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me i am sure i had better not write there can be no doubt of my getting home safe eleanor only replied i cannot wonder at your feelings i will not importune you i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you but this with the look of sorrow accompanying it was enough to melt catherine s pride in a moment and she instantly said oh eleanor i _will_ write to you indeed there was yet another point which miss tilney was anxious to settle though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of it had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey and upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation it proved to be exactly the case catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment but upon examining her purse was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together short however was that time the carriage was soon announced to be ready and catherine instantly rising a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu and as they entered the hall unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either she paused a moment and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left her kind remembrance for her absent friend but with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings and hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief she darted across the hall jumped into the chaise and in a moment was driven from the door chapter 29 catherine was too wretched to be fearful the journey in itself had no terrors for her and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness leaning back in one corner of the carriage in a violent burst of tears she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it unfortunately the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from woodston and for fourteen miles every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different every mile as it brought her nearer woodston added to her sufferings and when within the distance of five she passed the turning which led to it and thought of henry so near yet so unconscious her grief and agitation were excessive the day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life it was there it was on that day that the general had made use of such expressions with regard to henry and herself had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage yes only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard had he even confused her by his too significant reference and now what had she done or what had she omitted to do to merit such a change the only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained and equally safe did she believe her secret with each designedly at least henry could not have betrayed her if indeed by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation if aware of her having viewed him as a murderer she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house but a justification so full of torture to herself she trusted would not be in his power anxious as were all her conjectures on this point it was not however the one on which she dwelt most there was a thought yet nearer a more prevailing more impetuous concern how henry would think and feel and look when he returned on the morrow to northanger and heard of her being gone was a question of force and interest to rise over every other to be never ceasing alternately irritating and soothing it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment to the general of course he would not dare to speak but to eleanor what might he not say to eleanor about her in this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose the hours passed away and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for the pressing anxieties of thought which prevented her from noticing anything before her when once beyond the neighbourhood of woodston saved her at the same time from watching her progress and though no object on the road could engage a moment s attention she found no stage of it tedious from this she was preserved too by another cause by feeling no eagerness for her journey s conclusion for to return in such a manner to fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best even after an absence such as hers an eleven weeks absence what had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it extend an useless resentment and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will she could never do justice to henry and eleanor s merit she felt it too strongly for expression and should a dislike be taken against them should they be thought of unfavourably on their father s account it would cut her to the heart with these feelings she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving northanger but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it so great had been her ignorance of her route she met with nothing however to distress or frighten her her youth civil manners and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require and stopping only to change horses she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm and between six and seven o clock in the evening found herself entering fullerton a heroine returning at the close of her career to her native village in all the triumph of recovered reputation and all the dignity of a countess with a long train of noble relations in their several phaetons and three waiting maids in a travelling chaise and four behind her is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well delight to dwell it gives credit to every conclusion and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestows but my affair is widely different i bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and disgrace and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness a heroine in a hack post chaise is such a blow upon sentiment as no attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand swiftly therefore shall her post boy drive through the village amid the gaze of sunday groups and speedy shall be her descent from it but whatever might be the distress of catherine s mind as she thus advanced towards the parsonage and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went first in the appearance of her carriage and secondly in herself the chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in fullerton the whole family were immediately at the window and to have it stop at the sweep gate was a pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy a pleasure quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children a boy and girl of six and four years old who expected a brother or sister in every carriage happy the glance that first distinguished catherine happy the voice that proclaimed the discovery but whether such happiness were the lawful property of george or harriet could never be exactly understood her father mother sarah george and harriet all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness was a sight to awaken the best feelings of catherine s heart and in the embrace of each as she stepped from the carriage she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible so surrounded so caressed she was even happy in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued and the pleasure of seeing her leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity they were all seated round the tea table which mrs morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her reluctantly and with much hesitation did she then begin what might perhaps at the end of half an hour be termed by the courtesy of her hearers an explanation but scarcely within that time could they at all discover the cause or collect the particulars of her sudden return they were far from being an irritable race far from any quickness in catching or bitterness in resenting affronts but here when the whole was unfolded was an insult not to be overlooked nor for the first half hour to be easily pardoned without suffering any romantic alarm in the consideration of their daughter s long and lonely journey mr and mrs morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered and that in forcing her on such a measure general tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly neither as a gentleman nor as a parent why he had done it what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as catherine herself but it did not oppress them by any means so long and after a due course of useless conjecture that it was a strange business and that he must be a very strange man grew enough for all their indignation and wonder though sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour my dear you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble said her mother at last depend upon it it is something not at all worth understanding i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement said sarah but why not do it civilly i am sorry for the young people returned mrs morland they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney catherine sighed well continued her philosophic mother i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets catherine hoped so too and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment but her spirits were quite worn down and to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish she readily agreed to her mother s next counsel of going early to bed her parents seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away and though when they all met the next morning her recovery was not equal to their hopes they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil they never once thought of her heart which for the parents of a young lady of seventeen just returned from her first excursion from home was odd enough as soon as breakfast was over she sat down to fulfil her promise to miss tilney whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend s disposition was already justified for already did catherine reproach herself with having parted from eleanor coldly with having never enough valued her merits or kindness and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure the strength of these feelings however was far from assisting her pen and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing eleanor tilney to compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation convey gratitude without servile regret be guarded without coldness and honest without resentment a letter which eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of and above all which she might not blush herself if henry should chance to see was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance and after long thought and much perplexity to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety the money therefore which eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart this has been a strange acquaintance observed mrs morland as the letter was finished soon made and soon ended i am sorry it happens so for mrs allen thought them very pretty kind of young people and you were sadly out of luck too in your isabella ah poor james well we must live and learn and the next new friends you make i hope will be better worth keeping catherine coloured as she warmly answered no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor if so my dear i dare say you will meet again some time or other do not be uneasy it is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years and then what a pleasure it will be mrs morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation the hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into catherine s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her she could never forget henry tilney or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment but he might forget her and in that case to meet her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed and her mother perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect proposed as another expedient for restoring her spirits that they should call on mrs allen the two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart and as they walked mrs morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of james s disappointment we are sorry for him said she but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with and who was so entirely without fortune and now after such behaviour we cannot think at all well of her just at present it comes hard to poor james but that will not last forever and i dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life for the foolishness of his first choice this was just such a summary view of the affair as catherine could listen to another sentence might have endangered her complaisance and made her reply less rational for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well known road it was not three months ago since wild with joyful expectation she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day with an heart light gay and independent looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it three months ago had seen her all this and now how altered a being did she return she was received by the allens with all the kindness which her unlooked for appearance acting on a steady affection would naturally call forth and great was their surprise and warm their displeasure on hearing how she had been treated though mrs morland s account of it was no inflated representation no studied appeal to their passions catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening said she she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself mr allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend and mrs allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself his wonder his conjectures and his explanations became in succession hers with the addition of this single remark i really have not patience with the general to fill up every accidental pause and i really have not patience with the general was uttered twice after mr allen left the room without any relaxation of anger or any material digression of thought a more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition and after completing the fourth she immediately added only think my dear of my having got that frightful great rent in my best mechlin so charmingly mended before i left bath that one can hardly see where it was i must show it you some day or other bath is a nice place catherine after all i assure you i did not above half like coming away mrs thorpe s being there was such a comfort to us was not it you know you and i were quite forlorn at first yes but _that_ did not last long said catherine her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there very true we soon met with mrs thorpe and then we wanted for nothing my dear do not you think these silk gloves wear very well i put them on new the first time of our going to the lower rooms you know and i have worn them a great deal since do you remember that evening do i oh perfectly it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on catherine could not answer and after a short trial of other subjects mrs allen again returned to i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know as they walked home again mrs morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter s mind the happiness of having such steady well wishers as mr and mrs allen and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the tilneys ought to have with her while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends there was a great deal of good sense in all this but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power and catherine s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced it was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended and while mrs morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations catherine was silently reflecting that _now_ henry must have arrived at northanger _now_ he must have heard of her departure and _now_ perhaps they were all setting off for hereford chapter 30 catherine s disposition was not naturally sedentary nor had her habits been ever very industrious but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased she could neither sit still nor employ herself for ten minutes together walking round the garden and orchard again and again as if nothing but motion was voluntary and it seemed as if she could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time in the parlour her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration in her rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself but in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she had been before for two days mrs morland allowed it to pass even without a hint but when a third night s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness improved her in useful activity nor given her a greater inclination for needlework she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful catherine took up her work directly saying in a dejected voice that her head did not run upon bath much then you are fretting about general tilney and that is very simple of you for ten to one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles after a short silence i hope my catherine you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as northanger that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat there is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance the mirror i think i will look it out for you some day or other because i am sure it will do you good catherine said no more and with an endeavour to do right applied to her work but after a few minutes sunk again without knowing it herself into languor and listlessness moving herself in her chair from the irritation of weariness much oftener than she moved her needle mrs morland watched the progress of this relapse and seeing in her daughter s absent and dissatisfied look the full proof of that repining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of cheerfulness hastily left the room to fetch the book in question anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady it was some time before she could find what she looked for and other family matters occurring to detain her a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes till on entering the room the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before with a look of much respect he immediately rose and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as mr henry tilney with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for his appearance there acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at fullerton and stating his impatience to be assured of miss morland s having reached her home in safety as the cause of his intrusion he did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart far from comprehending him or his sister in their father s misconduct mrs morland had been always kindly disposed towards each and instantly pleased by his appearance received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence thanking him for such an attention to her daughter assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there and entreating him to say not another word of the past he was not ill inclined to obey this request for though his heart was greatly relieved by such unlooked for mildness it was not just at that moment in his power to say anything to the purpose returning in silence to his seat therefore he remained for some minutes most civilly answering all mrs morland s common remarks about the weather and roads catherine meanwhile the anxious agitated happy feverish catherine said not a word but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of the mirror for a future hour desirous of mr morland s assistance as well in giving encouragement as in finding conversation for her guest whose embarrassment on his father s account she earnestly pitied mrs morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him but mr morland was from home and being thus without any support at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say after a couple of minutes unbroken silence henry turning to catherine for the first time since her mother s entrance asked her with sudden alacrity if mr and mrs allen were now at fullerton and on developing from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply the meaning which one short syllable would have given immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them and with a rising colour asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way you may see the house from this window sir was information on sarah s side which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman and a silencing nod from her mother for mrs morland thinking it probable as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours that he might have some explanation to give of his father s behaviour which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to catherine would not on any account prevent her accompanying him they began their walk and mrs morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it some explanation on his father s account he had to give but his first purpose was to explain himself and before they reached mr allen s grounds he had done it so well that catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often she was assured of his affection and that heart in return was solicited which perhaps they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own for though henry was now sincerely attached to her though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society i must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude or in other words that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought it is a new circumstance in romance i acknowledge and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine s dignity but if it be as new in common life the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own a very short visit to mrs allen in which henry talked at random without sense or connection and catherine wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness scarcely opened her lips dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête à tête and before it was suffered to close she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application on his return from woodston two days before he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father hastily informed in angry terms of miss morland s departure and ordered to think of her no more such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand the affrighted catherine amidst all the terrors of expectation as she listened to this account could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject and as he proceeded to give the particulars and explain the motives of his father s conduct her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight the general had had nothing to accuse her of nothing to lay to her charge but her being the involuntary unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own she was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims he had courted her acquaintance in bath solicited her company at northanger and designed her for his daughter in law on discovering his error to turn her from the house seemed the best though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself and his contempt of her family john thorpe had first misled him the general perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to miss morland had accidentally inquired of thorpe if he knew more of her than her name thorpe most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of general tilney s importance had been joyfully and proudly communicative and being at that time not only in daily expectation of morland s engaging isabella but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying catherine himself his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them with whomsoever he was or was likely to be connected his own consequence always required that theirs should be great and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew so regularly grew their fortune the expectations of his friend morland therefore from the first overrated had ever since his introduction to isabella been gradually increasing and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment by doubling what he chose to think the amount of mr morland s preferment trebling his private fortune bestowing a rich aunt and sinking half the children he was able to represent the whole family to the general in a most respectable light for catherine however the peculiar object of the general s curiosity and his own speculations he had yet something more in reserve and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to mr allen s estate her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of fullerton naturally followed upon such intelligence the general had proceeded for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority thorpe s interest in the family by his sister s approaching connection with one of its members and his own views on another circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth and to these were added the absolute facts of the allens being wealthy and childless of miss morland s being under their care and as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge of their treating her with parental kindness his resolution was soon formed already had he discerned a liking towards miss morland in the countenance of his son and thankful for mr thorpe s communication he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this than his own children henry and eleanor perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father s particular respect had seen with astonishment the suddenness continuance and extent of his attention and though latterly from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her henry was convinced of his father s believing it to be an advantageous connection it was not till the late explanation at northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on that they were false the general had learnt from the very person who had suggested them from thorpe himself whom he had chanced to meet again in town and who under the influence of exactly opposite feelings irritated by catherine s refusal and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between morland and isabella convinced that they were separated forever and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the morlands confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families with the most liberal proposals he had on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support they were in fact a necessitous family numerous too almost beyond example by no means respected in their own neighbourhood as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections a forward bragging scheming race the terrified general pronounced the name of allen with an inquiring look and here too thorpe had learnt his error the allens he believed had lived near them too long and he knew the young man on whom the fullerton estate must devolve the general needed no more enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself he set out the next day for the abbey where his performances have been seen i leave it to my reader s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for henry to communicate at this time to catherine how much of it he could have learnt from his father in what points his own conjectures might assist him and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from james i have united for their ease what they must divide for mine catherine at any rate heard enough to feel that in suspecting general tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife she had scarcely sinned against his character or magnified his cruelty henry in having such things to relate of his father was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself he blushed for the narrow minded counsel which he was obliged to expose the conversation between them at northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind henry s indignation on hearing how catherine had been treated on comprehending his father s views and being ordered to acquiesce in them had been open and bold the general accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family prepared for no reluctance but of feeling no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words could ill brook the opposition of his son steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it but in such a cause his anger though it must shock could not intimidate henry who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice he felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to miss morland and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger could shake his fidelity or influence the resolutions it prompted he steadily refused to accompany his father into herefordshire an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of catherine and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand the general was furious in his anger and they parted in dreadful disagreement henry in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose had returned almost instantly to woodston and on the afternoon of the following day had begun his journey to fullerton chapter 31 mr and mrs morland s surprise on being applied to by mr tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was for a few minutes considerable it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side but as nothing after all could be more natural than catherine s being beloved they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride and as far as they alone were concerned had not a single objection to start his pleasing manners and good sense were self evident recommendations and having never heard evil of him it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told goodwill supplying the place of experience his character needed no attestation catherine would make a sad heedless young housekeeper to be sure was her mother s foreboding remark but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice there was but one obstacle in short to be mentioned but till that one was removed it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement their tempers were mild but their principles were steady and while his parent so expressly forbade the connection they could not allow themselves to encourage it that the general should come forward to solicit the alliance or that he should even very heartily approve it they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded and that once obtained and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied their willing approbation was instantly to follow his _consent_ was all that they wished for they were no more inclined than entitled to demand his _money_ of a very considerable fortune his son was by marriage settlements eventually secure his present income was an income of independence and comfort and under every pecuniary view it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter the young people could not be surprised at a decision like this they felt and they deplored but they could not resent it and they parted endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general as each believed almost impossible might speedily take place to unite them again in the fulness of privileged affection henry returned to what was now his only home to watch over his young plantations and extend his improvements for her sake to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward and catherine remained at fullerton to cry whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence let us not inquire mr and mrs morland never did they had been too kind to exact any promise and whenever catherine received a letter as at that time happened pretty often they always looked another way the anxiety which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of henry and catherine and of all who loved either as to its final event can hardly extend i fear to the bosom of my readers who will see in the tell tale compression of the pages before them that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity the means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the general s the circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence which took place in the course of the summer an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour from which he did not recover till after eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of henry and his permission for him to be a fool if he liked it the marriage of eleanor tilney her removal from all the evils of such a home as northanger had been made by henry s banishment to the home of her choice and the man of her choice is an event which i expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance my own joy on the occasion is very sincere i know no one more entitled by unpretending merit or better prepared by habitual suffering to receive and enjoy felicity her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her his unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties and never had the general loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship utility and patient endurance as when he first hailed her your ladyship her husband was really deserving of her independent of his peerage his wealth and his attachment being to a precision the most charming young man in the world any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary the most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination of us all concerning the one in question therefore i have only to add aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing bills resulting from a long visit at northanger by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures the influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of mr morland s circumstances which as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed they were qualified to give it taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by thorpe s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor and that catherine would have three thousand pounds this was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence which he was at some pains to procure that the fullerton estate being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor was consequently open to every greedy speculation on the strength of this the general soon after eleanor s marriage permitted his son to return to northanger and thence made him the bearer of his consent very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to mr morland the event which it authorized soon followed henry and catherine were married the bells rang and everybody smiled and as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting it will not appear after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the general s cruelty that they were essentially hurt by it to begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty six and eighteen is to do pretty well and professing myself moreover convinced that the general s unjust interference so far from being really injurious to their felicity was perhaps rather conducive to it by improving their knowledge of each other and adding strength to their attachment i leave it to be settled by whomsoever it may concern whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny or reward filial disobedience \n"

            " emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister s marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr woodhouse s family less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming miss taylor s judgment but directed chiefly by her own the real evils indeed of emma s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments the danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness miss taylor married it was miss taylor s loss which first brought grief it was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance the wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost the event had every promise of happiness for her friend mr weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black morning s work for her the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day she recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella s marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent well informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault how was she to bear the change it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs weston only half a mile from them and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her no equals the woodhouses were first in consequence there all looked up to them she had many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day it was a melancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful his spirits required support he was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter s marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner poor miss taylor i wish she were here again what a pity it is that mr weston ever thought of her i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot mr weston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us we shall be always meeting _we_ must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance i could not walk half so far no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage to be sure the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you i am very glad i did think of her it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil pretty spoken girl i have a great opinion of her whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us he will be able to tell her how we all are emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own the backgammon table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary mr knightley a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabella s husband he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london he had returned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square it was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time mr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily when this was over mr woodhouse gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not catch cold dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding by the bye i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature said emma playfully that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by i believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse with a sigh i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome my dearest papa you do not think i could mean _you_ or suppose mr knightley to mean _you_ what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another mr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body emma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer well said emma willing to let it pass you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day dear emma bears every thing so well said her father but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion said mr knightley we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing mr knightley shook his head at her her father fondly replied ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know every body said that mr weston would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell s i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off match making i do not understand what you mean by success said mr knightley success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and _that_ is all that can be said and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that a straightforward open hearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others rejoined mr woodhouse understanding but in part but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one s family circle grievously only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day that will be a much better thing i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr knightley laughing and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself chapter ii mr weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property he had received a good education but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortune though her fortune bore no proportion to the family estate was not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the infinite mortification of mr and mrs churchill who threw her off with due decorum it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness mrs weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother s unreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved the boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother s been the means of a sort of reconciliation and mr and mrs churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease some scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could a complete change of life became desirable he quitted the militia and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening it was a concern which brought just employment enough he had still a small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away he had by that time realised an easy competence enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it he had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was his own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle s heir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his father s assistance his father had no apprehension of it the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely but it was not in mr weston s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern mr frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved now upon his father s marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention that the visit should take place there was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when mrs perry drank tea with mrs and miss bates or when mrs and miss bates returned the visit now was the time for mr frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs weston had received i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written to mrs weston i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed mr woodhouse told me of it mr woodhouse saw the letter and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life it was indeed a highly prized letter mrs weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured she felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her she knew that at times she must be missed and could not think without pain of emma s losing a single pleasure or suffering an hour s ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield so convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr weston s disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs weston and of moments only of regret and her satisfaction her more than satisfaction her cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity poor miss taylor when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own but never did she go without mr woodhouse s giving a gentle sigh and saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay there was no recovering miss taylor nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr woodhouse the compliments of his neighbours were over he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event and the wedding cake which had been a great distress to him was all eat up his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be different from himself what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly tried to prevent any body s eating it he had been at the pains of consulting mr perry the apothecary on the subject mr perry was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr woodhouse s life and upon being applied to he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that wedding cake might certainly disagree with many perhaps with most people unless taken moderately with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs weston s wedding cake in their hands but mr woodhouse would never believe it chapter iii mr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner parties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley comprehended many such not unfrequently through emma s persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card table for him real long standing regard brought the westons and mr knightley and by mr elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr woodhouse s drawing room and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away after these came a second set among the most come at able of whom were mrs and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses had it taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance mrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness her youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible and yet she was a happy woman and a woman whom no one named without good will it was her own universal good will and contented temper which worked such wonders she loved every body was interested in every body s happiness quicksighted to every body s merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body and a mine of felicity to herself she was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip mrs goddard was the mistress of a school not of a seminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systems and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but a real honest old fashioned boarding school where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education without any danger of coming back prodigies mrs goddard s school was in high repute and very deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church she was a plain motherly kind of woman who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea visit and having formerly owed much to mr woodhouse s kindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancy work whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect and happy was she for her father s sake in the power though as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of mrs weston she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day a note was brought from mrs goddard requesting in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody somebody had placed her several years back at mrs goddard s school and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour boarder this was all that was generally known of her history she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired she was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith s conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement encouragement should be given those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her the friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort of people must be doing her harm they were a family of the name of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm of mr knightley and residing in the parish of donwell very creditably she believed she knew mr knightley thought highly of them but they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect _she_ would notice her she would improve her she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good society she would form her opinions and her manners it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the in betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper table which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests upon such occasions poor mr woodhouse s feelings were in sad warfare he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough self approbation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart a _very_ little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to _half_ a glass of wine a _small_ half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you emma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last chapter iv harriet smith s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing quick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other as a walking companion emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her in that respect mrs weston s loss had been important her father never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied and since mrs weston s marriage her exercise had been too much confined she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant and a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to her early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smith s being exactly the young friend she wanted exactly the something which her home required such a friend as mrs weston was out of the question two such could never be granted two such she did not want it was quite a different sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent mrs weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful for mrs weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents but harriet could not tell she was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain emma was obliged to fancy what she liked but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth harriet had no penetration she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs goddard chose to tell her and looked no farther mrs goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversation and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey mill farm it must have been the whole but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place emma encouraged her talkativeness amused by such a picture of another set of beings and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs martin s having _two_ parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard s drawing room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs martin s saying as she was so fond of it it should be called _her_ cow and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter a son and son s wife who all lived together but when it appeared that the mr martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good nature in doing something or other was a single man that there was no young mrs martin no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin and there was evidently no dislike to it harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good humoured and obliging he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in every thing else he was so very obliging he had his shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her she was very fond of singing he could sing a little himself she believed he was very clever and understood every thing he had a very fine flock and while she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country she believed every body spoke well of him his mother and sisters were very fond of him mrs martin had told her one day and there was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he would make a good husband not that she _wanted_ him to marry she was in no hurry at all well done mrs martin thought emma you know what you are about and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send mrs goddard a beautiful goose the finest goose mrs goddard had ever seen mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he reads all _them_ to himself but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can the next question was what sort of looking man is mr martin oh not handsome not at all handsome i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now one does not you know after a time but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston he has passed you very often that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well what do you imagine his age to be he was four and twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day s difference which is very odd only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer s daughter without education to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no alarming symptoms of love the young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on harriet s side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own they met mr martin the very next day as they were walking on the donwell road he was on foot and after looking very respectfully at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin his appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriet s inclination harriet was not insensible of manner she had voluntarily noticed her father s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder mr martin looked as if he did not know what manner was they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not so genteel as real gentlemen i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man mr knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with _him_ you might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of _them_ compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference oh yes there is a great difference but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly but there may be pretty good guessing he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss will he indeed that will be very bad how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he _will_ thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ i wonder he did not remember the book was all harriet s answer and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself she therefore said no more for some time her next beginning was in one respect perhaps mr elton s manners are superior to mr knightley s or mr weston s they have more gentleness they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in _him_ because there is so much good humour with it but that would not do to be copied neither would mr knightley s downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits _him_ very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model mr elton is good humoured cheerful obliging and gentle he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be if he means any thing it must be to please you did not i tell you what he said of you the other day she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from mr elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed and smiled and said she had always thought mr elton very agreeable mr elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet s head she thought it would be an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural and probable for her to have much merit in planning it she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict it was not likely however that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet s coming to hartfield the longer she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency mr elton s situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself and without low connexions at the same time not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet he had a comfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient income for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known to have some independent property and she thought very highly of him as a good humoured well meaning respectable young man without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on harriet s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy and he was really a very pleasing young man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general though not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr elton s admiration chapter v i do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston said mr knightley of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing a bad thing do you really think it a bad thing why so i think they will neither of them do the other any good you surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure how very differently we feel not think they will do each other any good this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma mr knightley perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle mr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject we were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life i can imagine your objection to harriet smith she is not the superior young woman which emma s friend ought to be but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself they will read together she means it i know emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through and very good lists they were very well chosen and very neatly arranged sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule the list she drew up when only fourteen i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished you know you could not i dare say replied mrs weston smiling that i thought so _then_ but since we have parted i can never remember emma s omitting to do any thing i wished there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ said mr knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done but i he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her she inherits her mother s talents and must have been under subjection to her i should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on _your_ recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouse s family and wanted another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held yes said he smiling you are better placed _here_ very fit for a wife but not at all for a governess but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from _her_ on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor thank you there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr weston why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne we will not despair however weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him i hope not _that_ it is not likely no mr knightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter not i indeed i only name possibilities i do not pretend to emma s genius for foretelling and guessing i hope with all my heart the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune but harriet smith i have not half done about harriet smith i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned her ignorance is hourly flattery how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet i will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home i am much mistaken if emma s doctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life they only give a little polish i either depend more upon emma s good sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance how well she looked last night oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you very well i shall not attempt to deny emma s being pretty pretty say beautiful rather can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether face and figure i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers but i am a partial old friend such an eye the true hazle eye and so brilliant regular features open countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance one hears sometimes of a child being the picture of health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown up health she is loveliness itself mr knightley is not she i have not a fault to find with her person he replied i think her all you describe i love to look at her and i will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way mrs weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm and i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm with all dear emma s little faults she is an excellent creature where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred times very well i will not plague you any more emma shall be an angel and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children i am sure of having their opinions with me i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr knightley at this little remains of office not at all cried he i am much obliged to you for it it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to mrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry i will keep my ill humour to myself i have a very sincere interest in emma isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one feels for emma i wonder what will become of her so do i said mrs weston gently very much she always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present said mrs weston as can well be and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr woodhouse s account i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr weston s on the subject as much as possible there were wishes at randalls respecting emma s destiny but it was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition which mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield chapter vi emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr elton s being a remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet s side as there could be any occasion for she was quite convinced of mr elton s being in the fairest way of falling in love if not in love already she had no scruple with regard to him he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add his perception of the striking improvement of harriet s manner since her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment you have given miss smith all that she required said he you have made her graceful and easy she was a beautiful creature when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself i have done very little if it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant mr elton i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before exactly so that is what principally strikes me so much superadded decision of character skilful has been the hand great has been the pleasure i am sure i never met with a disposition more truly amiable i have no doubt of it and it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover she was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have harriet s picture did you ever have your likeness taken harriet said she did you ever sit for your picture harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say with a very interesting naïveté oh dear no never no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would give any money for it i almost long to attempt her likeness myself you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me it would be such a delight to have her picture let me entreat you cried mr elton it would indeed be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend i know what your drawings are how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at randalls yes good man thought emma but what has all that to do with taking likenesses you know nothing of drawing don t pretend to be in raptures about mine keep your raptures for harriet s face well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe i shall try what i can do harriet s features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch exactly so the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth i have not a doubt of your success pray pray attempt it as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit she thinks so little of her own beauty did not you observe her manner of answering me how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn oh yes i observed it i assure you it was not lost on me but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others emma wished to go to work directly and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits for not one of them had ever been hed that they might decide together on the best size for harriet her many beginnings were displayed miniatures half lengths whole lengths pencil crayon and water colours had been all tried in turn she had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to she played and sang and drew in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved there was merit in every drawing in the least hed perhaps the most her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same they were both in ecstasies a likeness pleases every body and miss woodhouse s performances must be capital no great variety of faces for you said emma i had only my own family to study from there is my father another of my father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore mrs weston again and again and again you see dear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion she would sit whenever i asked her there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet then here come all my attempts at three of those four children there they are henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mama s children ever were here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see he had nestled down his head most conveniently that s very like i am rather proud of little george the corner of the sofa is very good then here is my last unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size whole length my last and my best my brother mr john knightley this did not want much of being hed when i put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i had really made a very good likeness of it mrs weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like only too handsome too flattering but that was a fault on the right side after all this came poor dear isabella s cold approbation of yes it was a little like but to be sure it did not do him justice we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i could bear and so i never would h it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in brunswick square and as i said i did then forswear ever drawing any body again but for harriet s sake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_ i will break my resolution now mr elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe exactly so no husbands and wives with so interesting a consciousness that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once but as she wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait it was to be a whole length in water colours like mr john knightley s and was destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece the sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist but there was no doing any thing with mr elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence but was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to place himself elsewhere it then occurred to her to employ him in reading if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness indeed it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the irksomeness of miss smith s mr elton was only too happy harriet listened and emma drew in peace she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress and be charmed there was no being displeased with such an encourager for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible she could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable the sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on there was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure to give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both a standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations as mr elton s very promising attachment was likely to add harriet was to sit again the next day and mr elton just as he ought entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again by all means we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress of the picture which was rapid and happy every body who saw it was pleased but mr elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every criticism miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted observed mrs weston to him not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover the expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes it is the fault of her face that she has them not do you think so replied he i cannot agree with you it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature i never saw such a likeness in my life we must allow for the effect of shade you know you have made her too tall emma said mr knightley emma knew that she had but would not own it and mr elton warmly added oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know proportions fore shortening oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s exactly so indeed it is very pretty said mr woodhouse so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear i do not know any body who draws so well as you do the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear you sir may say any thing cried mr elton but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character the naïveté of miss smith s manners and altogether oh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such a likeness the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a few difficulties it must be done directly it must be done in london the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions must not be applied to because it was december and mr woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december but no sooner was the distress known to mr elton than it was removed his gallantry was always on the alert might he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it he could ride to london at any time it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand he was too good she could not endure the thought she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances and a very few minutes settled the business mr elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame and give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough what a precious deposit said he with a tender sigh as he received it this man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma i should say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love he is an excellent young man and will suit harriet exactly it will be an exactly so as he says himself but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal i come in for a pretty good share as a second but it is his gratitude on harriet s account chapter vii the very day of mr elton s going to london produced a fresh occasion for emma s services towards her friend harriet had been at hartfield as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell half a minute brought it all out she had heard as soon as she got back to mrs goddard s that mr martin had been there an hour before and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself and this letter was from him from mr martin and contained a direct proposal of marriage who could have thought it she was so surprized she did not know what to do yes quite a proposal of marriage and a very good letter at least she thought so and he wrote as if he really loved her very much but she did not know and so she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do emma was half ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can will you read the letter cried harriet pray do ii d rather you would emma was not sorry to be pressed she read and was surprized the style of the letter was much above her expectation there were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer it was short but expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling she paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion with a well well and was at last forced to add is it a good letter or is it too short yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowly so good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words it is so with some men yes i understand the sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse a better written letter harriet returning it than i had expected well said the still waiting harriet well and and what shall i do what shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard to this letter yes but what are you in doubt of you must answer it of course and speedily yes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me oh no no the letter had much better be all your own you will express yourself very properly i am sure there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing your meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind i am persuaded you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment you think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you in any doubt as to that i thought but i beg your pardon perhaps i have been under a mistake i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it harriet was silent with a little reserve of manner emma continued you mean to return a favourable answer i collect no i do not that is i do not mean what shall i do what would you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do i shall not give you any advice harriet i will have nothing to do with it this is a point which you must settle with your feelings i had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet contemplating the letter for a little while emma persevered in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say no directly it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you but do not imagine that i want to influence you oh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to but if you would just advise me what i had best do no no i do not mean that as you say one s mind ought to be quite made up one should not be hesitating it is a very serious thing it will be safer to say no perhaps do you think i had better say no not for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise you either way you must be the best judge of your own happiness if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate you blush harriet does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion at this moment whom are you thinking of the symptoms were favourable instead of answering harriet turned away confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though the letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted about without regard emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes at last with some hesitation harriet said miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin do you think i am right perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving dear harriet i give myself joy of this it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr martin while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbey mill farm now i am secure of you for ever harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck her forcibly you could not have visited me she cried looking aghast no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all good society i must have given you up dear me how should i ever have borne it it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more dear affectionate creature _you_ banished to abbey mill farm _you_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it he must have a pretty good opinion of himself i do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet her conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard for but that is quite a different thing from and you know though he may like me it does not follow that i should and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration thank you thank you my own sweet little friend we will not be parted a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter oh no and it is but a short letter too emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that her husband could write a good letter oh yes very nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions i am quite determined to refuse him but how shall i do what shall i say emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence the looking over his letter again in replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all this letter however was written and sealed and sent the business was hed and harriet safe she was rather low all the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr elton i shall never be invited to abbey mill again was said in rather a sorrowful tone nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield some time afterwards it was i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss nash would for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linen draper one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that people should like her so much the idea of mr elton was certainly cheering but still after a time she was tender hearted again towards the rejected mr martin now he has got my letter said she softly i wonder what they are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too i hope he will not mind it so very much let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed cried emma at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name my picture but he has left my picture in bond street has he so then i know nothing of mr elton no my dear little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger chapter viii harriet slept at hartfield that night for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to have a bed room appropriated to herself and emma judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible just at present she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs goddard s but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield to make a regular visit of some days while she was gone mr knightley called and sat some time with mr woodhouse and emma till mr woodhouse who had previously made up his mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it and was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples of his own civility to leave mr knightley for that purpose mr knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other well i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take emma s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour as the sun is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can i treat you without ceremony mr knightley we invalids think we are privileged people my dear sir do not make a stranger of me i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter emma will be happy to entertain you and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns my winter walk you cannot do better sir i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i think the sooner _you_ go the better i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you mr woodhouse at last was off but mr knightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat he began speaking of harriet and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before i cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting come said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you that you have improved her you have cured her of her school girl s giggle she really does you credit thank you i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may _you_ do not often overpower me with it you are expecting her again you say this morning almost every moment she has been gone longer already than she intended something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps highbury gossips tiresome wretches harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said nothing he presently added with a smile i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage indeed how so of what sort a very serious sort i assure you still smiling very serious i can think of but one thing who is in love with her who makes you their confidant emma was more than half in hopes of mr elton s having dropt a hint mr knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew mr elton looked up to him i have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter robert martin is the man her visit to abbey mill this summer seems to have done his business he is desperately in love and means to marry her he is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet means to marry him well well means to make her an offer then will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since _your_ making so much of her as in a line of society above him i was very much pleased with all that he said i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage he is an excellent young man both as son and brother i had no hesitation in advising him to marry he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had this happened the night before last now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs goddard s to day and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch pray mr knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterday certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred was not she the whole day with you come said she i will tell you something in return for what you have told me he did speak yesterday that is he wrote and was refused this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed and mr knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood up in tall indignation and said then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her what is the foolish girl about oh to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her nonsense a man does not imagine any such thing but what is the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if it is so but i hope you are mistaken i saw her answer nothing could be clearer you saw her answer you wrote her answer too emma this is your doing you persuaded her to refuse him and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her by your account he does seem to have had some scruples it is a pity that they were ever got over not harriet s equal exclaimed mr knightley loudly and warmly and with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you what are harriet smith s claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations she is known only as parlour boarder at a common school she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck even _your_ satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves is much above his it would be a degradation a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin whoever might be her parents said mr knightley whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it _was_ good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do to be sure cried she playfully i know _that_ is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said mr knightley presently though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my _letting_ her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried mr knightley robert martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone she did not repent what she had done she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence with only one attempt on emma s side to talk of the weather but he made no answer he was thinking the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain emma laughed and disclaimed he continued depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself i have done with match making indeed i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave off while i am well good morning to you said he rising and walking off abruptly he was very much vexed he felt the disappointment of the young man and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly emma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her s than in his she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary s wrong as mr knightley he walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her she was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives harriet s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy the possibility of the young man s coming to mrs goddard s that morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits and without having any such reason to give for her long absence she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind and convinced her that let mr knightley think or say what he would she had done nothing which woman s friendship and woman s feelings would not justify he had frightened her a little about mr elton but when she considered that mr knightley could not have observed him as she had done neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of mr knightley s pretensions with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew any thing about he certainly might have heard mr elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and mr elton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them but then mr knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives mr knightley saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest and more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very sure did not belong to mr elton harriet s cheerful look and manner established hers she came back not to think of mr martin but to talk of mr elton miss nash had been telling her something which she repeated immediately with great delight mr perry had been to mrs goddard s to attend a sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met mr elton and found to his great surprize that mr elton was actually on his road to london and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whist club night which he had been never known to miss before and mr perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do mr elton had been determined to go on and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious mr perry could not quite understand him but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case and he told him so and mr elton only looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits miss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about mr elton and said looking so very significantly at her that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom mr elton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt mr elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness chapter ix mr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel with herself he was so much displeased that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven she was sorry but could not repent on the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after mr elton s return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting room he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought and as for harriet s feelings they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr martin s being no otherwise remembered than as he furnished a contrast with mr elton of the utmost advantage to the latter her views of improving her little friend s mind by a great deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few first chapters and the intention of going on to morrow it was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harriet s fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon miss nash head teacher at mrs goddard s had written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken the first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhouse s help to get a great many more emma assisted with her invention memory and taste and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form as well as quantity mr woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young he wondered he could not remember them but he hoped he should in time and it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind but he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about so much something he thought might come from that quarter it was by no means his daughter s wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition mr elton was the only one whose assistance she asked he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums that he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections and at the same time as she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled and rather sentimentally recited that well known charade my first doth affliction denote which my second is destin d to feel and my whole is the best antidote that affliction to soften and heal made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton said she that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you oh no he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life the stupidest fellow he was afraid not even miss woodhouse he stopt a moment or miss smith could inspire him the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration he called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own i do not offer it for miss smith s collection said he being my friend s i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma could understand there was deep consciousness about him and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend s he was gone the next moment after another moment s pause take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards harriet it is for you take your own but harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and emma never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself to miss charade my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth their luxury and ease another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas but ah united what reverse we have man s boasted power and freedom all are flown lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave and woman lovely woman reigns alone thy ready wit the word will soon supply may its approval beam in that soft eye she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through again to be quite certain and quite mistress of the lines and then passing it to harriet sat happily smiling and saying to herself while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness very well mr elton very well indeed i have read worse charades _courtship_ a very good hint i give you credit for it this is feeling your way this is saying very plainly pray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance may its approval beam in that soft eye harriet exactly soft is the very word for her eye of all epithets the justest that could be given thy ready wit the word will soon supply humph harriet s ready wit all the better a man must be very much in love indeed to describe her so ah mr knightley i wish you had the benefit of this i think this would convince you for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken an excellent charade indeed and very much to the purpose things must come to a crisis soon now she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the eagerness of harriet s wondering questions what can it be miss woodhouse what can it be i have not an idea i cannot guess it in the least what can it possibly be do try to find it out miss woodhouse do help me i never saw any thing so hard is it kingdom i wonder who the friend was and who could be the young lady do you think it is a good one can it be woman and woman lovely woman reigns alone can it be neptune behold him there the monarch of the seas or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only one syllable it must be very clever or he would not have brought it oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you thinking of where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark give me the paper and listen for miss read miss smith my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth their luxury and ease that is _court_ another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas that is _ship_ plain as it can be now for the cream but ah united _courtship_ you know what reverse we have man s boasted power and freedom all are flown lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave and woman lovely woman reigns alone a very proper compliment and then follows the application which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending read it in comfort to yourself there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion she read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness she could not speak but she was not wanted to speak it was enough for her to feel emma spoke for her there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment said she that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton s intentions you are his object and you will soon receive the completest proof of it i thought it must be so i thought i could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other i am very happy i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating this is a connexion which offers nothing but good it will give you every thing that you want consideration independence a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us dear miss woodhouse and dear miss woodhouse was all that harriet with many tender embraces could articulate at first but when they did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw felt anticipated and remembered just as she ought mr elton s superiority had very ample acknowledgment whatever you say is always right cried harriet and therefore i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could not have imagined it it is so much beyond any thing i deserve mr elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions about _him_ he is so very superior only think of those sweet verses to miss dear me how clever could it really be meant for me i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that it is a certainty receive it on my judgment it is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matter of fact prose it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected i am sure a month ago i had no more idea myself the strangest things do take place when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted they do indeed and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow the course of true love never did run smooth a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage that mr elton should really be in love with me me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arm in arm with mr cole this is an alliance which whoever whatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools if they are anxious to see you _happily_ married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be _well_ married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them yes very true how nicely you talk i love to hear you you understand every thing you and mr elton are one as clever as the other this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read i never read one more to the purpose certainly it is as long again as almost all we have had before i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour such things in general cannot be too short harriet was too intent on the lines to hear the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind it is one thing said she presently her cheeks in a glow to have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr martin s prose such sweet lines continued harriet these two last but how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it out oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that leave it to me you do nothing he will be here this evening i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming trust to me oh miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book i am sure i have not got one half so good leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book oh but those two lines are the best of all granted for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change but take it away and all _appropriation_ ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither give me the book i will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity i shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she very well replied emma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all you must let me read it to him harriet looked grave my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade you will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you do not let us be too solemn on the business he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade oh no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it do as you please mr woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears how does your book go on have you got any thing fresh yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh a piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read slowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations of every part as she proceeded and he was very much pleased and as she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion aye that s very just indeed that s very properly said very true woman lovely woman it is such a pretty charade my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought it nobody could have written so prettily but you emma emma only nodded and smiled after a little thinking and a very tender sigh he added ah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother was so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i can remember nothing not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza and there are several kitty a fair but frozen maid kindled a flame i yet deplore the hood wink d boy i called to aid though of his near approach afraid so fatal to my suit before and that is all that i can recollect of it but it is very clever all the way through but i think my dear you said you had got it yes papa it is written out in our second page we copied it from the elegant extracts it was garrick s you know aye very true i wish i could recollect more of it kitty a fair but frozen maid the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama i hope we shall have her here next week have you thought my dear where you shall put her and what room there will be for the children oh yes she will have her own room of course the room she always has and there is the nursery for the children just as usual you know why should there be any change i do not know my dear but it is so long since she was here not since last easter and then only for a few days mr john knightley s being a lawyer is very inconvenient poor isabella she is sadly taken away from us all and how sorry she will be when she comes not to see miss taylor here she will not be surprized papa at least i do not know my dear i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married we must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella is here yes my dear if there is time but in a very depressed tone she is coming for only one week there will not be time for any thing it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer but it seems a case of necessity mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey mr knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas though you know it is longer since they were with him than with us it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield mr woodhouse could never allow for mr knightley s claims on his brother or any body s claims on isabella except his own he sat musing a little while and then said but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does i think emma i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us she and the children might stay very well ah papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband this was too true for contradiction unwelcome as it was mr woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter s attachment to her husband she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleased with the children we are very proud of the children are not we papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john aye i wonder which she will poor little dears how glad they will be to come they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father john the second is named after his father some people are surprized i believe that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry which i thought very pretty of her and he is a very clever boy indeed they are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways they will come and stand by my chair and say grandpapa can you give me a bit of string and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas i think their father is too rough with them very often he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other well i cannot understand it that is the case with us all papa one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o clock dinner the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again harriet turned away but emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push of having thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up his ostensible reason however was to ask whether mr woodhouse s party could be made up in the evening without him or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield if he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with him had made such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber he re urged she re declined and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smith s collection your friend will not take it amiss i hope of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines mr elton certainly did not very well know what to say he looked rather doubtingly rather confused said something about honour glanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively with the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two he may be sure of every woman s approbation while he writes with such gallantry i have no hesitation in saying replied mr elton though hesitating a good deal while he spoke i have no hesitation in saying at least if my friend feels at all as _i_ do i have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as _i_ see it looking at the book again and replacing it on the table he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life after this speech he was gone as soon as possible emma could not think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh she ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet s share chapter x though now the middle of december there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise and on the morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who lived a little way out of highbury their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street of the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode of mr elton a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage an old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it could be it had no advantage of situation but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes emma s remark was there it is there go you and your riddle book one of these days harriet s was oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much i do not often walk this way _now_ said emma as they proceeded but _then_ there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury harriet she found had never in her life been inside the vicarage and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors and probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love with mr elton s seeing ready wit in her i wish we could contrive it said she but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper no message from my father she pondered but could think of nothing after a mutual silence of some minutes harriet thus began again i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are emma laughed and replied my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry i must find other people charming one other person at least and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ah so you say but i cannot believe it i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr elton you know recollecting herself is out of the question and i do _not_ wish to see any such person i would rather not be tempted i cannot really change for the better if i were to marry i must expect to repent it dear me it is so odd to hear a woman talk so i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine fortune i do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband s house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates so silly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry to morrow but between _us_ i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried but still you will be an old maid and that s so dreadful never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet work and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephews and nieces i shall often have a niece with me do you know miss bates s niece that is i know you must have seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury by the bye _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece heaven forbid at least that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were superseded emma was very compassionate and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse she understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good will in the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to harriet as they walked away these are the sights harriet to do one good how trifling they make every thing else appear i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind very true said harriet poor creatures one can think of nothing else and really i do not think the impression will soon be over said emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them into the lane again i do not think it will stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still greater within oh dear no said her companion they walked on the lane made a slight bend and when that bend was passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near as to give emma time only to say farther ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts well smiling i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves harriet could just answer oh dear yes before the gentleman joined them the wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting he had been going to call on them his visit he would now defer but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done mr elton then turned back to accompany them to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase of love on each side i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration it must if i were not here i wish i were anywhere else anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that in short they would both be soon after her this would not do she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half boot and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would follow in half a minute they did as they were desired and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot she had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken by a child from the cottage setting out according to orders with her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield to walk by the side of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been acting just then without design and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her she gained on them however involuntarily the child s pace was quick and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them mr elton was speaking with animation harriet listening with a very pleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more when they both looked around and she was obliged to join them mr elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday s party at his friend cole s and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the celery the beet root and all the dessert this would soon have led to something better of course was her consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart if i could but have kept longer away they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and fall behind to arrange it once more she then broke the lace off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am to contrive i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i hope i am not often so ill equipped mr elton i must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on mr elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied and looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately communicated the door between them was open and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it but she fully intended that mr elton should close it it was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself it could be protracted no longer she was then obliged to be hed and make her appearance the lovers were standing together at one of the windows it had a most favourable aspect and for half a minute emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully but it would not do he had not come to the point he had been most agreeable most delightful he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious cautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure still however though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them forward to the great event chapter xi mr elton must now be left to himself it was no longer in emma s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures the coming of her sister s family was so very near at hand that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expected she did not herself expect that any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers they might advance rapidly if they would however they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no she hardly wished to have more leisure for them there are people who the more you do for them the less they will do for themselves mr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest till this year every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea bathing for the children and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions or seen at all by mr woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london even for poor isabella s sake and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms were needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished and mr and mrs john knightley their five children and a competent number of nursery maids all reaching hartfield in safety the bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs john knightley that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance all the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing which they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them mrs john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate wrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible she could never see a fault in any of them she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also much of his constitution was delicate in her own health over careful of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own mr wingfield in town as her father could be of mr perry they were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance mr john knightley was a tall gentleman like and very clever man rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour he was not an ill tempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his great perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing he was not a great favourite with his fair sister in law nothing wrong in him escaped her she was quick in feeling the little injuries to isabella which isabella never felt herself perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabella s sister but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend without praise and without blindness but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father there he had not always the patience that could have been wished mr woodhouse s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill bestowed it did not often happen for mr john knightley had really a great regard for his father in law and generally a strong sense of what was due to him but it was too often for emma s charity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured though the offence came not the beginning however of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality they had not been long seated and composed when mr woodhouse with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughter s attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last ah my dear said he poor miss taylor it is a grievous business oh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must miss her and dear emma too what a dreadful loss to you both i have been so grieved for you i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her it is a sad change indeed but i hope she is pretty well sir pretty well my dear i hope pretty well i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably mr john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply and do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father mr woodhouse hesitated not near so often my dear as i could wish oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth just as it should be said mr john knightley and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied why to be sure said mr woodhouse yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston i think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can me my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor where is the young man said john knightley has he been here on this occasion or has he not he has not been here yet replied emma there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps my dear papa he is three and twenty you forget how time passes three and twenty is he indeed well i could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept 28th and began my dear madam but i forget how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill i remember that perfectly how very pleasing and proper of him cried the good hearted mrs john knightley i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy observed mr john knightley coolly but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr weston and had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass she would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important it had a high claim to forbearance chapter xii mr knightley was to dine with them rather against the inclination of mr woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him in isabella s first day emma s sense of right however had decided it and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr knightley and herself in procuring him the proper invitation she hoped they might now become friends again she thought it was time to make up making up indeed would not do _she_ certainly had not been in the wrong and _he_ would never own that he had concession must be out of the question but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her the youngest a nice little girl about eight months old who was now making her first visit to hartfield and very happy to be danced about in her aunt s arms it did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike to be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong yes said he smiling and reason good i was sixteen years old when you were born a material difference then she replied and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer yes a good deal _nearer_ but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now that s true she cried very true little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited now mr knightley a word or two more and i have done as far as good intentions went we were _both_ right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong i only want to know that mr martin is not very very bitterly disappointed a man cannot be more so was his short full answer ah indeed i am very sorry come shake hands with me this had just taken place and with great cordiality when john knightley made his appearance and how d ye do george and john how are you succeeded in the true english style burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment which would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing for the good of the other the evening was quiet and conversable as mr woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella and the little party made two natural divisions on one side he and his daughter on the other the two mr knightleys their subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixing and emma only occasionally joining in one or the other the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative and who was always the greater talker as a magistrate he had generally some point of law to consult john about or at least some curious anecdote to give and as a farmer as keeping in hand the home farm at donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear next year and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong the plan of a drain the change of a fence the felling of a tree and the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn was entered into with as much equality of interest by john as his cooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness while they were thus comfortably occupied mr woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter my poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand and interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one of her five children how long it is how terribly long since you were here and how tired you must be after your journey you must go to bed early my dear and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together my dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the mr knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself and two basins only were ordered after a little more discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say with an air of grave reflection it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here i never had much opinion of the sea air mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat both sea air and bathing ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once come come cried emma feeling this to be an unsafe subject i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you oh good mr perry how is he sir why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where and mrs perry and the children how are they do the children grow i have a great regard for mr perry i hope he will be calling soon he will be so pleased to see my little ones i hope he will be here to morrow for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence and my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little bella s throat oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since august it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates said emma i have not heard one inquiry after them oh the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well good old mrs bates i will call upon her to morrow and take my children they are always so pleased to see my children and that excellent miss bates such thorough worthy people how are they sir why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago how sorry i am but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn mr wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy except when it has been quite an influenza that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november perry does not call it altogether a sickly season no i do not know that mr wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always a sickly season nobody is healthy in london nobody can be it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off and the air so bad no indeed _we_ are not at all in a bad air our part of london is very superior to most others you must not confound us with london in general my dear sir the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest we are so very airy i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in but _we_ are so remarkably airy mr wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air ah my dear it is not like hartfield you make the best of it but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same now i cannot say that i think you are any of you looking well at present i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case i trust at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband middling my dear i cannot compliment you i think mr john knightley very far from looking well what is the matter sir did you speak to me cried mr john knightley hearing his own name i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home my dear isabella exclaimed he hastily pray do not concern yourself about my looks be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother cried emma about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong and she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing worse to hear than isabella s kind inquiry after jane fairfax and jane fairfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising that sweet amiable jane fairfax said mrs john knightley it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all she would be such a delightful companion for emma mr woodhouse agreed to it all but added our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet i am most happy to hear it but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior and exactly emma s age this topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of similar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said much praise and many comments undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably but unfortunately among the failures which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in her own cook at south end a young woman hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin often as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able to get any thing tolerable here was a dangerous opening ah said mr woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern the ejaculation in emma s ear expressed ah there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end it does not bear talking of and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel after an interval of some minutes however he began with i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here but why should you be sorry sir i assure you it did the children a great deal of good and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end south end is an unhealthy place perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere perry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the sea bathing places a fine open sea he says and very pure air and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea a quarter of a mile off very comfortable you should have consulted perry but my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how great it would have been an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill judged measure emma s attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he had reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her brother in law s breaking out mr perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another i may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry i want his directions no more than his drugs he paused and growing cooler in a moment added with only sarcastic dryness if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself true true cried mr knightley with most ready interposition very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion mr woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother and better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it chapter xiii there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs john knightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister she had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly it was a delightful visit perfect in being much too short in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas mr weston would take no denial they must all dine at randalls one day even mr woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party how they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty if he could but as his son and daughter s carriage and horses were actually at hartfield he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also harriet mr elton and mr knightley their own especial set were the only persons invited to meet them the hours were to be early as well as the numbers few mr woodhouse s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing the evening before this great event for it was a very great event that mr woodhouse should dine out on the 24th of december had been spent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house emma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat mrs goddard was full of care and affection mr perry was talked of and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss without many tears emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mrs goddard s unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much mr elton s would be depressed when he knew her state and left her at last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much she had not advanced many yards from mrs goddard s door when she was met by mr elton himself evidently coming towards it and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid of whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going to inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfield they were overtaken by mr john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for they joined company and proceeded together emma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her a quick low pulse c and she was sorry to find from mrs goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore throats and had often alarmed her with them mr elton looked all alarm on the occasion as he exclaimed a sore throat i hope not infectious i hope not of a putrid infectious sort has perry seen her indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend let me entreat you to run no risks why does not perry see her emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs goddard s experience and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwards as if quite another subject it is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night mr elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of her s he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit but emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening you do quite right said she we will make your apologies to mr and mrs weston but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were mr elton s only objection and mr elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction it was a done thing mr elton was to go and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her well said she to herself this is most strange after i had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behind most strange indeed but there is i believe in many men especially single men such an inclination such a passion for dining out a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to it and this must be the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked what a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her soon afterwards mr elton quitted them and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs goddard s for news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be able to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour after a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley began with i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works mr elton s manners are not perfect replied emma but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority there is such perfect good temper and good will in mr elton as one cannot but value yes said mr john knightley presently with some slyness he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you me she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to be mr elton s object such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now mr elton in love with me what an idea i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly i think your manners to him encouraging i speak as a friend emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken mr elton and i are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel he said no more mr woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others too full of the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it the cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage was in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour the preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least which mr john knightley did not by any means like he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent a man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing it is the greatest absurdity actually snowing at this moment the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home and the folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem it and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man s house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the very true my love which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence she allowed him to talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening her lips they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and mr elton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject mr elton was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her she had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the same not better _my_ report from mrs goddard s said she presently was not so pleasant as i had hoped not better was _my_ answer his face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered oh no i am grieved to find i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs goddard s door which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse very much grieved and concerned i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning emma smiled and answered my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed mr perry has been with her as you probably heard yes i imagined that is i did not he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day dreadful exactly so indeed she will be missed every moment this was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable but it should have lasted longer emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment what an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin for carriages how very comfortable they make it impossible to feel cold with such precautions the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely of no consequence it is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter ha snows a little i see yes said john knightley and i think we shall have a good deal of it christmas weather observed mr elton quite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this day s party which it might very possibly have done for mr woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings at christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather i was snowed up at a friend s house once for a week nothing could be pleasanter i went for only one night and could not get away till that very day se nnight mr john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but said only coolly i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls at another time emma might have been amused but she was too much astonished now at mr elton s spirits for other feelings harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party we are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort charming people mr and mrs weston mrs weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society it will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any mr weston s dining room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part i would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two i think you will agree with me turning with a soft air to emma i think i shall certainly have your approbation though mr knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of london may not quite enter into our feelings i know nothing of the large parties of london sir i never dine with any body indeed in a tone of wonder and pity i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment my first enjoyment replied john knightley as they passed through the sweep gate will be to find myself safe at hartfield again chapter xiv some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs weston s drawing room mr elton must compose his joyous looks and mr john knightley disperse his ill humour mr elton must smile less and mr john knightley more to fit them for the place emma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as happy as she was to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons mr weston was a great favourite and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself she could tell nothing of hartfield in which mrs weston had not a lively concern and half an hour s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends was one of the first gratifications of each this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day s visit might not afford which certainly did not belong to the present half hour but the very sight of mrs weston her smile her touch her voice was grateful to emma and she determined to think as little as possible of mr elton s oddities or of any thing else unpleasant and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost the misfortune of harriet s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival mr woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own and isabella s coming and of emma s being to follow and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter when the others appeared and mrs weston who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma emma s project of forgetting mr elton for a while made her rather sorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion instead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me absurd and insufferable yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be so interested about her father and so delighted with mrs weston and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would be lover and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners for her own sake she could not be rude and for harriet s in the hope that all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil but it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst the others in the most overpowering period of mr elton s nonsense which she particularly wished to listen to she heard enough to know that mr weston was giving some information about his son she heard the words my son and frank and my son repeated several times over and from a few other half syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son but before she could quiet mr elton the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward now it so happened that in spite of emma s resolution of never marrying there was something in the name in the idea of mr frank churchill which always interested her she had frequently thought especially since his father s marriage with miss taylor that if she _were_ to marry he was the very person to suit her in age character and condition he seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of that mr and mrs weston did think of it she was very strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him or by any body else to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for she had a great curiosity to see him a decided intention of finding him pleasant of being liked by him to a certain degree and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends imaginations with such sensations mr elton s civilities were dreadfully ill timed but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very cross and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again or the substance of it from the open hearted mr weston so it proved for when happily released from mr elton and seated by mr weston at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to her we want only two more to be just the right number i should like to see two more here your pretty little friend miss smith and my son and then i should say we were quite complete i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing room that we are expecting frank i had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a fortnight emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented to his proposition of mr frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete he has been wanting to come to us continued mr weston ever since september every letter has been full of it but he cannot command his own time he has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another put off she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do but she does not know the parties so well as i do the case you see is but this is quite between ourselves i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room there are secrets in all families you know the case is that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january and that frank s coming depends upon their being put off if they are not put off he cannot stir but i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point i have not the smallest doubt of the issue i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice of doing i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied emma but am disposed to side with you mr weston if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe yes i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life she is an odd woman but i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank s account for i do believe her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper emma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to mrs weston very soon after their moving into the drawing room wishing her joy yet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming mrs weston agreed to it but added that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of for i cannot depend upon his coming i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing mr weston i dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world my emma replied mrs weston smiling what is the certainty of caprice then turning to isabella who had not been attending before you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill replied isabella and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them emma wished she had been alone with mrs weston she should then have heard more mrs weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella and she really believed would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge but at present there was nothing more to be said mr woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing room to be sitting long after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable while he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity of saying and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine he ought to come said emma if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s not having it in his power to do as much as that a young _woman_ if she fall into bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young _man_ s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do replied mrs weston one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules _she_ is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite now according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_ she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be emma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied unless he comes he may have a great deal of influence on some points continued mrs weston and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us chapter xv mr woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour before the other gentlemen appeared mr weston was chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort but at last the drawing room party did receive an augmentation mr elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in mrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa he joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr frank churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend her fair lovely amiable friend did she know had she heard any thing about her since their being at randalls he felt much anxiety he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably and in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat and emma was quite in charity with him but at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on harriet s more anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick chamber again for the present to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her she was vexed it did appear there was no concealing it exactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty in behaving with temper he turned to mrs weston to implore her assistance would not she give him her support would not she add her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs goddard s till it were certain that miss smith s disorder had no infection he could not be satisfied without a promise would not she give him her influence in procuring it so scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless for herself she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to day and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself is this fair mrs weston judge between us have not i some right to complain i am sure of your kind support and aid emma saw mrs weston s surprize and felt that it must be great at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose she could only give him a look but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving her all her attention she had not time to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidly did another subject succeed for mr john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind concluding with these words to mr woodhouse this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow poor mr woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else had something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer mrs weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son in law who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly i admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon every body must have seen the snow coming on i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight mr weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest it should make mr woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty he wished the road might be impassable that he might be able to keep them all at randalls and with the utmost good will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him that with a little contrivance every body might be lodged which she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done was mr woodhouse s first exclamation and all that he could say for some time to her he looked for comfort and her assurances of safety her representation of the excellence of the horses and of james and of their having so many friends about them revived him a little his eldest daughter s alarm was equal to his own the horror of being blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager to have it settled that her father and emma should remain at randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them you had better order the carriage directly my love said she i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk i am not at all afraid i should not mind walking half the way i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold indeed replied he then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold walk home you are prettily shod for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses isabella turned to mrs weston for her approbation of the plan mrs weston could only approve isabella then went to emma but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away and they were still discussing the point when mr knightley who had left the room immediately after his brother s first report of the snow came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence he had gone beyond the sweep some way along the highbury road the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground a very few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting and there was every appearance of its being soon over he had seen the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend to isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father s account who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending mr knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences thus your father will not be easy why do not you go i am ready if the others are shall i ring the bell yes do and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for a few minutes more and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over the carriage came and mr woodhouse always the first object on such occasions was carefully attended to his own by mr knightley and mr weston but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for he was afraid they should have a very bad drive he was afraid poor isabella would not like it and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind he did not know what they had best do they must keep as much together as they could and james was talked to and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage isabella stept in after her father john knightley forgetting that he did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally so that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them and that they were to have a tête à tête drive it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure previous to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked to him of harriet and the three quarters of a mile would have seemed but one but now she would rather it had not happened she believed he had been drinking too much of mr weston s good wine and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense to restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had they passed the sweep gate and joined the other carriage than she found her subject cut up her hand seized her attention demanded and mr elton actually making violent love to her availing himself of the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already well known hoping fearing adoring ready to die if she refused him but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect and in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible it really was so without scruple without apology without much apparent diffidence mr elton the lover of harriet was professing himself _her_ lover she tried to stop him but vainly he would go on and say it all angry as she was the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour accordingly with a mixture of the serious and the playful which she hoped would best suit his half and half state she replied i am very much astonished mr elton this to _me_ you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to _me_ if you please miss smith message to miss smith what could she possibly mean and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful pretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness mr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in such a manner command yourself enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it but mr elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at all to confuse his intellects he perfectly knew his own meaning and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at all he resumed the subject of his own passion and was very urgent for a favourable answer as she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied it is impossible for me to doubt any longer you have made yourself too clear mr elton my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express after such behaviour as i have witnessed during the last month to miss smith such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing to be addressing me in this manner this is an unsteadiness of character indeed which i had not supposed possible believe me sir i am far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions good heaven cried mr elton what can be the meaning of this miss smith i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence never paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and i am very sorry extremely sorry but miss smith indeed oh miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character i have thought only of you i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself you cannot really seriously doubt it no in an accent meant to be insinuating i am sure you have seen and understood me it would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing this which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr elton s sanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he joyously exclaimed charming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence it confesses that you have long understood me no sir cried emma it confesses no such thing so far from having long understood you i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views till this moment as to myself i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings nothing could be farther from my wishes your attachment to my friend harriet your pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith that you have never thought seriously of her never madam cried he affronted in his turn never i assure you _i_ think seriously of miss smith miss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to every body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received encouragement i give you encouragement sir you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance i am exceedingly sorry but it is well that the mistake ends where it does had the same behaviour continued miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views not being aware probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of but as it is the disappointment is single and i trust will not be lasting i have no thoughts of matrimony at present he was too angry to say another word her manner too decided to invite supplication and in this state of swelling resentment and mutually deep mortification they had to continue together a few minutes longer for the fears of mr woodhouse had confined them to a foot pace if there had not been so much anger there would have been desperate awkwardness but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane or when it stopped they found themselves all at once at the door of his house and he was out before another syllable passed emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night the compliment was just returned coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits she was then conveyed to hartfield there she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage lane turning a corner which he could never bear to think of and in strange hands a mere common coachman no james and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well for mr john knightley ashamed of his ill humour was now all kindness and attention and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father as to seem if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party except herself but her mind had never been in such perturbation and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection chapter xvi the hair was curled and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think and be miserable it was a wretched business indeed such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for such a development of every thing most unwelcome such a blow for harriet that was the worst of all every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort or other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken more in error more disgraced by mis judgment than she actually was could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have borne any thing he might have doubled his presumption to me but poor harriet how she could have been so deceived he protested that he had never thought seriously of harriet never she looked back as well as she could but it was all confusion she had taken up the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it his manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious or she could not have been so misled the picture how eager he had been about the picture and the charade and an hundred other circumstances how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet to be sure the charade with its ready wit but then the soft eyes in fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth who could have seen through such thick headed nonsense certainly she had often especially of late thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way as a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the gentleness of his address true elegance was sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never for an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harriet s friend to mr john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject for the first start of its possibility there was no denying that those brothers had penetration she remembered what mr knightley had once said to her about mr elton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that mr elton would never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself it was dreadfully mortifying but mr elton was proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full of his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others contrary to the usual course of things mr elton s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion his professions and his proposals did him no service she thought nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes he wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for there had been no real affection either in his language or manners sighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less allied with real love she need not trouble herself to pity him he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty or with ten but that he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry him should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind look down upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her it was most provoking perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield the younger branch of a very ancient family and that the eltons were nobody the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all the rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself in every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility but he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must have been his dependence and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy like mr elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite if _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder that _he_ with self interest to blind him should have mistaken hers the first error and the worst lay at her door it was foolish it was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together it was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more here have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man she might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him oh that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin there i was quite right that was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left the rest to time and chance i was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having i ought not to have attempted more but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time i have been but half a friend to her and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her william coxe oh no i could not endure william coxe a pert young lawyer she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed a more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been and might be and must be the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffering with the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings concealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully to youth and natural cheerfulness like emma s though under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to depend on getting tolerably out of it it was a great consolation that mr elton should not be really in love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him that harriet s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive and that there could be no necessity for any body s knowing what had passed except the three principals and especially for her father s being given a moment s uneasiness about it these were very cheering thoughts and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present the weather was most favourable for her though christmas day she could not go to church mr woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas the ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most honourable prisoner no intercourse with harriet possible but by note no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day and no need to find excuses for mr elton s absenting himself it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house too wise to stir out and to hear him say to mr knightley whom no weather could keep entirely from them ah mr knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr elton these days of confinement would have been but for her private perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly suited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off his ill humour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield he was always agreeable and obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body but with all the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease chapter xvii mr and mrs john knightley were not detained long at hartfield the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move and mr woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole party set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella which poor isabella passing her life with those she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults and always innocently busy might have been a model of right feminine happiness the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr elton to mr woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note to say with mr elton s best compliments that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath where in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends he had engaged to spend a few weeks and very much regretted the impossibility he was under from various circumstances of weather and business of taking a personal leave of mr woodhouse of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense and had mr woodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them emma was most agreeably surprized mr elton s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired she admired him for contriving it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father from which she was so pointedly excluded she had not even a share in his opening compliments her name was not mentioned and there was so striking a change in all this and such an ill judged solemnity of leave taking in his graceful acknowledgments as she thought at first could not escape her father s suspicion it did however her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey and his fears that mr elton might never get safely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language it was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening mr woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman s return she went to mrs goddard s accordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary penance of communication and a severe one it was she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her ideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last six weeks the confession completely renewed her first shame and the sight of harriet s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again harriet bore the intelligence very well blaming nobody and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching seemed on harriet s side not her own harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of the affection of such a man as mr elton would have been too great a distinction she never could have deserved him and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible her tears fell abundantly but her grief was so truly artless that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma s eyes and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the two and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple minded and ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of her life her second duty now inferior only to her father s claims was to promote harriet s comfort and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match making she got her to hartfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness striving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation to drive mr elton from her thoughts time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr elton in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet s age and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr elton s return as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them harriet did think him all perfection and maintained the non existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness and did in truth prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen but yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force if mr elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine harriet s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for each for all three not one of them had the power of removal or of effecting any material change of society they must encounter each other and make the best of it harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs goddard s mr elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth where the wound had been given there must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace for herself chapter xviii mr frank churchill did not come when the time proposed drew near mrs weston s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse for the present he could not be spared to his very great mortification and regret but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period mrs weston was exceedingly disappointed much more disappointed in fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober but a sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression it soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again for half an hour mr weston was surprized and sorry but then he began to perceive that frank s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan better time of year better weather and that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner these feelings rapidly restored his comfort while mrs weston of a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer suffered a great deal more herself emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr frank churchill s not coming except as a disappointment at randalls the acquaintance at present had no charm for her she wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it was desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance and enter as warmly into mr and mrs weston s disappointment as might naturally belong to their friendship she was the first to announce it to mr knightley and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps rather more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry the pleasure of looking at somebody new the gala day to highbury entire which the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections on the churchills again found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr knightley and to her great amusement perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion and making use of mrs weston s arguments against herself the churchills are very likely in fault said mr knightley coolly but i dare say he might come if he would i do not know why you should say so he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof how odd you are what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january a man at his age what is he three or four and twenty cannot be without the means of doing as much as that it is impossible that s easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master you are the worst judge in the world mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot want money he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some watering place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth this proves that he can leave the churchills yes sometimes he can and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to morrow if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going no said emma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine such conduct practicable depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now we shall never agree about him cried emma but that is nothing extraordinary i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not mr weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of man s perfection i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s having any right to complain his letters disgust me your feelings are singular they seem to satisfy every body else i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be very amiable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him you seem determined to think ill of him me not at all replied mr knightley rather displeased i do not want to think ill of him i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is well grown and good looking with smooth plausible manners well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley what a _sensation_ his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him and mine said mr knightley warmly is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man the practised politician who is to read every body s character and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point i will say no more about him cried emma you turn every thing to evil we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here prejudiced i am not prejudiced but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it my love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour he is a person i never think of from one month s end to another said mr knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma immediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend why he should be angry to take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him for with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid to his charge she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another volume ii chapter i emma and harriet had been walking together one morning and in emma s opinion had been talking enough of mr elton for that day she could not think that harriet s solace or her own sins required more and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive mr elton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done they were just approaching the house where lived mrs and miss bates she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers there was always sufficient reason for such an attention mrs and miss bates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts she had had many a hint from mr knightley and some from her own heart as to her deficiency but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable a waste of time tiresome women and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second rate and third rate of highbury who were calling on them for ever and therefore she seldom went near them but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in observing as she proposed it to harriet that as well as she could calculate they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax the house belonged to people in business mrs and miss bates occupied the drawing room floor and there in the very moderate sized apartment which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after mr woodhouse s health cheerful communications about her mother s and sweet cake from the beaufet mrs cole had just been there just called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an hour with them and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr elton there was intimacy between them and mr cole had heard from mr elton since his going away emma knew what was coming they must have the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone and how much he was engaged in company and what a favourite he was wherever he went and how full the master of the ceremonies ball had been and she went through it very well with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always putting forward to prevent harriet s being obliged to say a word this she had been prepared for when she entered the house but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury and their card parties she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr elton but he was actually hurried off by miss bates she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles to usher in a letter from her niece oh yes mr elton i understand certainly as to dancing mrs cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was mrs cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very great a favourite there whenever she is with us mrs cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can and so she began inquiring after her directly saying i know you cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time for writing and when i immediately said but indeed we have we had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized have you upon your honour said she well that is quite unexpected do let me hear what she says emma s politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well thank you you are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt while eagerly hunting for the letter oh here it is i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her a letter from jane that she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says but first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letter only two pages you see hardly two and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well she often says when the letter is first opened well hetty now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker work don t you ma am and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word and indeed though my mother s eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles it is such a blessing my mother s are really very good indeed jane often says when she is here i am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do and so much fine work as you have done too i only wish my eyes may last me as well all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfax s handwriting you are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse s my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know ma am addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it she was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming very rude of making her escape from jane fairfax s letter and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention my mother s deafness is very trifling you see just nothing at all by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mother s time of life and it really is full two years you know since she was here we never were so long without seeing her before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now are you expecting miss fairfax here soon oh yes next week indeed that must be a very great pleasure thank you you are very kind yes next week every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see her yes friday or saturday she cannot say which because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days so very good of them to send her the whole way but they always do you know oh yes friday or saturday next that is what she writes about that is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday yes so i imagined i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to day so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon my mother is so delighted for she is to be three months with us at least three months she says so positively as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland mrs dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them again for till she married last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother or her father i declare i do not know which it was but we shall see presently in jane s letter wrote in mr dixon s name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat baly craig a beautiful place i fancy jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses and as jane used to be very often walking out with them for colonel and mrs campbell were very particular about their daughter s not walking out often with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself he is a most amiable charming young man i believe jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emma s brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr dixon and the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell very true very true indeed the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months together not able to come if any thing was to happen but you see every thing turns out for the best they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to come over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation jane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention he is a most charming young man ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit i can never think of it without trembling but ever since we had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs bates yes entirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel and mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately i am concerned to hear of it i think they judge wisely but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed mrs dixon i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax oh no you are very obliging to say such things but certainly not there is no comparison between them miss campbell always was absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable yes that of course jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th of november as i am going to read to you and has never been well since a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us just like her so considerate but however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we should do it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following as you will find from jane s letter so sudden you may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with bless me poor jane is ill which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her i am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet and beginning to rise my father will be expecting us i had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes when i first entered the house i merely called because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs bates but i have been so pleasantly detained now however we must wish you and mrs bates good morning and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded she regained the street happy in this that though much had been forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfax s letter she had been able to escape the letter itself chapter ii jane fairfax was an orphan the only child of mrs bates s youngest daughter the marriage of lieut fairfax of the regiment of infantry and miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure hope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards and this girl by birth she belonged to highbury and when at three years old on losing her mother she became the property the charge the consolation the foundling of her grandmother and aunt there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there of her being taught only what very limited means could command and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person good understanding and warm hearted well meaning relations but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny this was colonel campbell who had very highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for such attentions during a severe camp fever as he believed had saved his life these were claims which he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in his power when he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her he was a married man with only one living child a girl about jane s age and jane became their guest paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old his daughter s great fondness for her and his own wish of being a real friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education it was accepted and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbell s family and had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother from time to time the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbell s power for though his income by pay and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter s but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter such was jane fairfax s history she had fallen into good hands known nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given an excellent education living constantly with right minded and well informed people her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbell s residence being in london every lighter talent had been done full justice to by the attendance of first rate masters her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children fully competent to the office of instruction herself but she was too much beloved to be parted with neither father nor mother could promote and the daughter could not endure it the evil day was put off it was easy to decide that she was still too young and jane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society and a judicious mixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of jane s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents they continued together with unabated regard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of mr dixon a young man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly and happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn this event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning she had long resolved that one and twenty should be the period with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate she had resolved at one and twenty to complete the sacrifice and retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse equal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever the good sense of colonel and mrs campbell could not oppose such a resolution though their feelings did as long as they lived no exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly but this would be selfishness what must be at last had better be soon perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished still however affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter s marriage and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength they must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits seemed under the most favourable circumstances to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some truths not told it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health than on any thing else certain it was that she was to come and that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it mr frank churchill must put up for the present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness of a two years absence emma was sorry to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months to be always doing more than she wished and less than she ought why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer mr knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time there were moments of self examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her but she could never get acquainted with her she did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reserve such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not and then her aunt was such an eternal talker and she was made such a fuss with by every body and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate because their ages were the same every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other these were her reasons she had no better it was a dislike so little just every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating jane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had herself the highest value for elegance her height was pretty just such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most becoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance of ill health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two emma could not but feel all this and then her face her features there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty her eyes a deep grey with dark eye lashes and eyebrows had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom it was a style of beauty of which elegance was the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her principles admire it elegance which whether of person or of mind she saw so little in highbury there not to be vulgar was distinction and merit in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike her no longer when she took in her history indeed her situation as well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance was destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going to live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect especially if to every well known particular entitling her to interest were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr dixon which she had so naturally started to herself in that case nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr dixon s affections from his wife or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first if it were love it might be simple single successless love on her side alone she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison while a sharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best the purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit to ireland and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty upon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings as made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her these were charming feelings but not lasting before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors than saying to mr knightley she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state former provocations reappeared the aunt was as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself and jane s offences rose again they had music emma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance she was besides which was the worst of all so cold so cautious there was no getting at her real opinion wrapt up in a cloak of politeness she seemed determined to hazard nothing she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved if any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr dixon s character or her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness of the match it was all general approbation and smoothness nothing delineated or distinguished it did her no service however her caution was thrown away emma saw its artifice and returned to her first surmises there probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference mr dixon perhaps had been very near changing one friend for the other or been fixed only to miss campbell for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds the like reserve prevailed on other topics she and mr frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time it was known that they were a little acquainted but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was was he handsome she believed he was reckoned a very fine young man was he agreeable he was generally thought so did he appear a sensible young man a young man of information at a watering place or in a common london acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points manners were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr churchill she believed every body found his manners pleasing emma could not forgive her chapter iii emma could not forgive her but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr knightley who had been of the party and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with mr woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma he had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement a very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers swept away particularly pleasant you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma you left nothing undone i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmother s it must have been a real indulgence i am happy you approved said emma smiling but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield no my dear said her father instantly _that_ i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough no said mr knightley nearly at the same time you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension i think you understand me therefore an arch look expressed i understand you well enough but she said only miss fairfax is reserved i always told you she was a little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence what arises from discretion must be honoured you think her diffident i do not see it my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close by her you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant evening oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained i am disappointed was his only answer i hope every body had a pleasant evening said mr woodhouse in his quiet way i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the present said and with a sincerity which no one could question she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart mr knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express and before he could make any reply mr woodhouse whose thoughts were on the bates s said it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and i have often wished but it is so little one can venture to do small trifling presents of any thing uncommon now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate hartfield pork is not like any other pork but still it is pork and my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork i think we had better send the leg do not you think so my dear my dear papa i sent the whole hind quarter i knew you would wish it there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like that s right my dear very right i had not thought of it before but that is the best way they must not over salt the leg and then if it is not over salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome emma said mr knightley presently i have a piece of news for you you like news and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you news oh yes i always like news what is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at randalls he had time only to say no not at randalls i have not been near randalls when the door was thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room full of thanks and full of news miss bates knew not which to give quickest mr knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him oh my dear sir how are you this morning my dear miss woodhouse i come quite over powered such a beautiful hind quarter of pork you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr elton is going to be married emma had not had time even to think of mr elton and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start and a little blush at the sound there is my news i thought it would interest you said mr knightley with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them but where could _you_ hear it cried miss bates where could you possibly hear it mr knightley for it is not five minutes since i received mrs cole s note no it cannot be more than five or at least ten for i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come out i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork jane was standing in the passage were not you jane for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan large enough so i said i would go down and see and jane said shall i go down instead for i think you have a little cold and patty has been washing the kitchen oh my dear said i well and just then came the note a miss hawkins that s all i know a miss hawkins of bath but mr knightley how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr cole told mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me a miss hawkins i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly well that is quite i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting my dear sir you really are too bountiful my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her we consider our hartfield pork replied mr woodhouse indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us we may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course here was a sly glance at emma he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled mr elton going to be married said emma as soon as she could speak he will have every body s wishes for his happiness he is very young to settle was mr woodhouse s observation he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse said miss bates joyfully my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him jane s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her no i have never seen mr elton she replied starting on this appeal is he is he a tall man who shall answer that question cried emma my father would say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir turning to mr woodhouse i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her said emma nothing i suppose can be known one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance he has been gone only four weeks nobody had any information to give and after a few more wonderings emma said you are silent miss fairfax but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell s account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins when i have seen mr elton replied jane i dare say i shall be interested but i believe it requires _that_ with me and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse said miss bates four weeks yesterday a miss hawkins well i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i ever mrs cole once whispered to me but i immediately said no mr elton is a most worthy young man but in short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries i do not pretend to it what is before me i see at the same time nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspired miss woodhouse lets me chatter on so good humouredly she knows i would not offend for the world how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now have you heard from mrs john knightley lately oh those dear little children jane do you know i always fancy mr dixon like mr john knightley i mean in person tall and with that sort of look and not very talkative quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all very odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand one takes up a notion and runs away with it mr dixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome handsome oh no far from it certainly plain i told you he was plain my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself oh as for me my judgment is worth nothing where i have a regard i always think a person well looking but i gave what i believed the general opinion when i called him plain well my dear jane i believe we must be running away the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed i shall just go round by mrs cole s but i shall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directly i would not have you out in a shower we think she is the better for highbury already thank you we do indeed i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing good morning to you my dear sir oh mr knightley is coming too well that is so very i am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm mr elton and miss hawkins good morning to you emma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry and to marry strangers too and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news as proving that mr elton could not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet harriet must feel it and all that she could hope was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly from others it was now about the time that she was likely to call if she were to meet miss bates in her way and upon its beginning to rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs goddard s and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation the shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the oh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation as the blow was given emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening and harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what she had to tell she had set out from mrs goddard s half an hour ago she had been afraid it would rain she had been afraid it would pour down every moment but she thought she might get to hartfield first she had hurried on as fast as possible but then as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast as she could and took shelter at ford s ford s was the principal woollen draper linen draper and haberdasher s shop united the shop first in size and fashion in the place and so there she had set without an idea of any thing in the world full ten minutes perhaps when all of a sudden who should come in to be sure it was so very odd but they always dealt at ford s who should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother dear miss woodhouse only think i thought i should have fainted i did not know what to do i was sitting near the door elizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and i kept sitting near the door oh dear i was so miserable i am sure i must have been as white as my gown i could not go away you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there oh dear miss woodhouse well at last i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me do you think he was miss woodhouse for presently she came forward came quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands if i would she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i said i was in such a tremble i remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think i found he was coming up towards me too slowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke and i answered and i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully you know one can t tell how and then i took courage and said it did not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by mr cole s stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round by the stables i believe i did but i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it oh miss woodhouse i would rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly and elizabeth too oh miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again very sincerely did emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in her power she was obliged to stop and think she was not thoroughly comfortable herself the young man s conduct and his sister s seemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them as harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour but she had believed them to be well meaning worthy people before and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion it was folly to be disturbed by it of course he must be sorry to lose her they must be all sorry ambition as well as love had probably been mortified they might all have hoped to rise by harriet s acquaintance and besides what was the value of harriet s description so easily pleased so little discerning what signified her praise she exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite unworthy of being dwelt on it might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it harriet said very true and she would not think about it but still she talked of it still she could talk of nothing else and emma at last in order to put the martins out of her head was obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give with so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a state of mind in poor harriet such a conclusion of mr elton s importance with her mr elton s rights however gradually revived though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining any influence to alarm as harriet now lived the martins could not get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her refusal of the brother the sisters never had been at mrs goddard s and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again with any necessity or even any power of speech chapter iv human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations that a young person who either marries or dies is sure of being kindly spoken of a week had not passed since miss hawkins s name was first mentioned in highbury before she was by some means or other discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind to be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable and when mr elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects and circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more for him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose music she principally played mr elton returned a very happy man he had gone away rejected and mortified disappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing the right lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one he had gone away deeply offended he came back engaged to another and to another as superior of course to the first as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost he came back gay and self satisfied eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse and defying miss smith the charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune of so many thousands as would always be called ten a point of some dignity as well as some convenience the story told well he had not thrown himself away he had gained a woman of 10 000 _l_ or thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice the history which he had to give mrs cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious the steps so quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at mr green s and the party at mrs brown s smiles and blushes rising in importance with consciousness and agitation richly scattered the lady had been so easily impressed so sweetly disposed had in short to use a most intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him that vanity and prudence were equally contented he had caught both substance and shadow both fortune and affection and was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself and his own concerns expecting to be congratulated ready to be laughed at and with cordial fearless smiles now addressing all the young ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago he would have been more cautiously gallant the wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves to please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for and when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation which a certain glance of mrs cole s did not seem to contradict that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride during his present short stay emma had barely seen him but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension now spread over his air she was in fact beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance a lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again she wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly be lessened by his marriage many vain solicitudes would be prevented many awkwardnesses smoothed by it a _mrs _ _elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark it would be almost beginning their life of civility again of the lady individually emma thought very little she was good enough for mr elton no doubt accomplished enough for highbury handsome enough to look plain probably by harriet s side as to connexion there emma was perfectly easy persuaded that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet he had done nothing on that article truth seemed attainable _what_ she was must be uncertain but _who_ she was might be found out and setting aside the 10 000 l it did not appear that she was at all harriet s superior she brought no name no blood no alliance miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol merchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath but bristol was her home the very heart of bristol for though the father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remained in the law line nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter had lived emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney and too stupid to rise and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister who was _very_ _well_ _married_ to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ near bristol who kept two carriages that was the wind up of the history that was the glory of miss hawkins could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all she had talked her into love but alas she was not so easily to be talked out of it the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet s mind was not to be talked away he might be superseded by another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer even a robert martin would have been sufficient but nothing else she feared would cure her harriet was one of those who having once begun would be always in love and now poor girl she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr elton she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other emma saw him only once but two or three times every day harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him or _just_ to miss him _just_ to hear his voice or see his shoulder _just_ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture she was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when at hartfield she was always among those who saw no fault in mr elton and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns and every report therefore every guess all that had already occurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs comprehending income servants and furniture was continually in agitation around her her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins s happiness and continual observation of how much he seemed attached his air as he walked by the house the very sitting of his hat being all in proof of how much he was in love had it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain to her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of harriet s mind emma would have been amused by its variations sometimes mr elton predominated sometimes the martins and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other mr elton s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr martin the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martin s calling at mrs goddard s a few days afterwards harriet had not been at home but a note had been prepared and left for her written in the very style to touch a small mixture of reproach with a great deal of kindness and till mr elton himself appeared she had been much occupied by it continually pondering over what could be done in return and wishing to do more than she dared to confess but mr elton in person had driven away all such cares while he staid the martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin s visit how that visit was to be acknowledged what would be necessary and what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful consideration absolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would be ingratitude it must not be and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance after much thinking she could determine on nothing better than harriet s returning the visit but in a way that if they had understanding should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill while she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future she could think of nothing better and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve something of ingratitude merely glossed over it must be done or what would become of harriet chapter v small heart had harriet for visiting only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs goddard s her evil stars had led her to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to _the rev philip elton white hart bath_ was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher s cart which was to convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world excepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank she went however and when they reached the farm and she was to be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier apple trees to the front door the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour she went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married and settled in donwell the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again and miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay and unattended by any alarming young man she came solitarily down the gravel walk a miss martin just appearing at the door and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account she was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating she had seen only mrs martin and the two girls they had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time till just at last when mrs martin s saying all of a sudden that she thought miss smith was grown had brought on a more interesting subject and a warmer manner in that very room she had been measured last september with her two friends there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window _he_ had done it they all seemed to remember the day the hour the party the occasion to feel the same consciousness the same regrets to be ready to return to the same good understanding and they were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma must suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage reappeared and all was over the style of the visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago emma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally harriet must suffer it was a bad business she would have given a great deal or endured a great deal to have had the martins in a higher rank of life they were so deserving that a _little_ higher should have been enough but as it was how could she have done otherwise impossible she could not repent they must be separated but there was a great deal of pain in the process so much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure it her mind was quite sick of mr elton and the martins the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary it was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard that neither master nor mistress was at home they had both been out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield this is too bad cried emma as they turned away and now we shall just miss them too provoking i do not know when i have been so disappointed and she leaned back in the corner to indulge her murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of both such being the commonest process of a not ill disposed mind presently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt by mr and mrs weston who were standing to speak to her there was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound for mr weston immediately accosted her with how d ye do how d ye do we have been sitting with your father glad to see him so well frank comes to morrow i had a letter this morning we see him to morrow by dinner time to a certainty he is at oxford to day and he comes for a whole fortnight i knew it would be so if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days i was always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather we shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr weston s confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not less to the purpose to know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits the worn out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moment s thought she hoped mr elton would now be talked of no more mr weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command as well as the route and the method of his journey and she listened and smiled and congratulated i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech from his wife we had better move on mr weston said she we are detaining the girls well well i am ready and turning again to emma but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man you have only had _my_ account you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing think of me to morrow my dear emma about four o clock was mrs weston s parting injunction spoken with some anxiety and meant only for her four o clock depend upon it he will be here by three was mr weston s quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting emma s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore a different air james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to harriet she saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford was a question however which did not augur much but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time the morning of the interesting day arrived and mrs weston s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve o clock that she was to think of her at four my dear dear anxious friend said she in mental soliloquy while walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful for every body s comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here i am sure they will bring him soon she opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father mr weston and his son they had been arrived only a few minutes and mr weston had scarcely hed his explanation of frank s being a day before his time and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when she appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure the frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest was actually before her he was presented to her and she did not think too much had been said in his praise he was a _very_ good looking young man height air address all were unexceptionable and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father s he looked quick and sensible she felt immediately that she should like him and there was a well bred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be he had reached randalls the evening before she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan and travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half a day i told you yesterday cried mr weston with exultation i told you all that he would be here before the time named i remembered what i used to do myself one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far but in coming _home_ i felt i might do any thing the word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable the conviction was strengthened by what followed he was very much pleased with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house would hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation the walk to highbury highbury itself hartfield still more and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one s _own_ country gives and the greatest curiosity to visit it that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously through emma s brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled his manner had no air of study or exaggeration he did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance on his side were the inquiries was she a horsewoman pleasant rides pleasant walks had they a large neighbourhood highbury perhaps afforded society enough there were several very pretty houses in and about it balls had they balls was it a musical society but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his mother in law and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs weston but undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter he understood what would be welcome he could be sure of little else his father s marriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor s merits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse s character than miss woodhouse miss taylor s and at last as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings said emma were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ i should listen with pleasure but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman i hope i should know better he replied no depend upon it with a gallant bow that in addressing mrs weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance she must see more of him to understand his ways at present she only felt they were agreeable she had no doubt of what mr weston was often thinking about his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening her own father s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them she blessed the favouring blindness he could now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest give way to all his natural kind hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr frank churchill s accommodation on his journey through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold which however he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night a reasonable visit paid mr weston began to move he must be going he had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands for mrs weston at ford s but he need not hurry any body else his son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also saying as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house though fairfax i believe is not the proper name i should rather say barnes or bates do you know any family of that name to be sure we do cried his father mrs bates we passed her house i saw miss bates at the window true true you are acquainted with miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine girl she is call upon her by all means there is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which oh go to day go to day do not defer it what is right to be done cannot be done too soon and besides i must give you a hint frank any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on if you do not call early it will be a slight the son looked convinced i have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma she is a very elegant young woman he agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it if you were never particularly struck by her manners before said she i think you will to day you will see her to advantage see her and hear her no i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you said mr woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street mr frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could and his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump they were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one and a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day with full confidence in their comfort chapter vi the next morning brought mr frank churchill again he came with mrs weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially he had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home till her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse their walk immediately fixed on highbury he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him he should always chuse the same highbury that airy cheerful happy looking highbury would be his constant attraction highbury with mrs weston stood for hartfield and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him they walked thither directly emma had hardly expected them for mr weston who had called in for half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in arm she was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in company with mrs weston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend if he were deficient there nothing should make amends for it but on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection and there was time enough for emma to form a reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning they were all three walking about together for an hour or two first round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards in highbury he was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently for mr woodhouse s ear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long and which had been the home of his father s father and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit they shewed altogether a good will towards highbury in general which must be very like a merit to those he was with emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making a parade of insincere professions and that mr knightley certainly had not done him justice their first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house though the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of post horses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built many years ago for a ball room and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used as such but such brilliant days had long passed away and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half gentlemen of the place he was immediately interested its character as a ball room caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge none which they suggested no it was long enough broad enough handsome enough it would hold the very number for comfort they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room she who could do any thing in highbury the want of proper families in the place and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied he could not be persuaded that so many good looking houses as he saw around him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting and even when particulars were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body s returning into their proper place the next morning he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills he seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe of pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference to a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind he could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap it was but an effusion of lively spirits at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged emma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had paid it yes oh yes he replied i was just going to mention it a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before and how did you think miss fairfax looking ill very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health a most deplorable want of complexion emma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss fairfax s complexion it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face he listened with all due deference acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same but yet he must confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health where features were indifferent a fine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good the effect was fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was well said emma there is no disputing about taste at least you admire her except her complexion he shook his head and laughed i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society at this moment they were approaching ford s and he hastily exclaimed ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ford s if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury i must buy something at ford s it will be taking out my freedom i dare say they sell gloves oh yes gloves and every thing i do admire your patriotism you will be adored in highbury you were very popular before you came because you were mr weston s son but lay out half a guinea at ford s and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues they went in and while the sleek well tied parcels of men s beavers and york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter he said but i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ do not let me lose it i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given her account i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her may i indeed then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well i met her frequently at weymouth i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly warm hearted woman i like them all you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be yes rather hesitatingly i believe i do you get upon delicate subjects emma said mrs weston smiling remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life i will move a little farther off i certainly do forget to think of _her_ said emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment when the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play said frank churchill ever hear her repeated emma you forget how much she belongs to highbury i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began she plays charmingly you think so do you i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body s performance i have been used to hear her s admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof proof indeed said emma highly amused mr dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof certainly very strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if _i_ had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me i could not excuse a man s having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it it was her very particular friend you know poor comfort said emma laughing one would rather have a stranger preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland you are right it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it so much the better or so much the worse i do not know which but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her quickness of friendship or dulness of feeling there was one person i think who must have felt it miss fairfax herself she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction as to that i do not oh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax s sensations from you or from any body else they are known to no human being i guess but herself but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends but we never did i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set and then her reserve i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved it is a most repulsive quality indeed said he oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater but i must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question i have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal he perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long and thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting he was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she had expected his ideas seemed more moderate his feelings warmer she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr elton s house which as well as the church he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much fault with no he could not believe it a bad house not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having if it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house there must be ample room in it for every real comfort the man must be a blockhead who wanted more mrs weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about used only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one but emma in her own mind determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper s room or a bad butler s pantry but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment chapter vii emma s very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day by hearing that he was gone off to london merely to have his hair cut a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast and he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to return to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve it did not accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense or even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday vanity extravagance love of change restlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs weston indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became liable to all these charges his father only called him a coxcomb and thought it a very good story but that mrs weston did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible and making no other comment than that all young people would have their little whims with the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him mrs weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether he appeared to have a very open temper certainly a very cheerful and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of him said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself and though there was no being attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect this was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him the honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near it and saved only by her own indifference for still her resolution held of never marrying the honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance mr weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must have some weight he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremely thought her very beautiful and very charming and with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him harshly as mrs weston observed all young people would have their little whims there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so leniently disposed in general he was judged throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury with great candour liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man one who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit among them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows or smiles mr knightley the circumstance was told him at hartfield for the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand hum just the trifling silly fellow i took him for she had half a mind to resent but an instant s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings and not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings mr and mrs weston s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune something occurred while they were at hartfield to make emma want their advice and which was still more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave this was the occurrence the coles had been settled some years in highbury and were very good sort of people friendly liberal and unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin in trade and only moderately genteel on their first coming into the country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means the house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them with their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company they added to their house to their number of servants to their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune and style of living second only to the family at hartfield their love of society and their new dining room prepared every body for their keeping dinner company and a few parties chiefly among the single men had already taken place the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite neither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls nothing should tempt _her_ to go if they did and she regretted that her father s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish the coles were very respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them this lesson she very much feared they would receive only from herself she had little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her very differently affected donwell and randalls had received their invitation and none had come for her father and herself and mrs weston s accounting for it with i suppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out was not quite sufficient she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred again and again she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence might not the evening end in a dance had been a question of his the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits and her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment was but poor comfort it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her first remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful she owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely without inclination for the party the coles expressed themselves so properly there was so much real attention in the manner of it so much consideration for her father they would have solicited the honour earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a folding screen from london which they hoped might keep mr woodhouse from any draught of air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company upon the whole she was very persuadable and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort how certainly mrs goddard if not mrs bates might be depended on for bearing him company mr woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spending the whole evening away from him as for _his_ going emma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late and the party too numerous he was soon pretty well resigned i am not fond of dinner visiting said he i never was no more is emma late hours do not agree with us i am sorry mr and mrs cole should have done it i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with us take us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you will both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy then turning to mrs weston with a look of gentle reproach ah miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me well sir cried mr weston as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it but the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_ was increasing not lessening mr woodhouse s agitation the ladies knew better how to allay it mr weston must be quiet and every thing deliberately arranged with this treatment mr woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual he should be happy to see mrs goddard he had a great regard for mrs goddard and emma should write a line and invite her james could take the note but first of all there must be an answer written to mrs cole you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible you will say that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my _compliments_ of course but you will do every thing right i need not tell you what is to be done we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday i shall have no fears for you with him we have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour you will not like staying late you will get very tired when tea is over but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa oh no my love but you will soon be tired there will be a great many people talking at once you will not like the noise but my dear sir cried mr weston if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party and no great harm if it does said mr woodhouse the sooner every party breaks up the better but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are good natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought of than any other person s in the room you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious mr cole is very bilious no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends oh yes papa i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account i am only afraid of your sitting up for me i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort you must promise me not to sit up he did on the condition of some promises on her side such as that if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly if hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid should sit up for her and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house as usual chapter viii frank churchill came back again and if he kept his father s dinner waiting it was not known at hartfield for mrs weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr woodhouse to betray any imperfection which could be concealed he came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with a very good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done he had no reason to wish his hair longer to conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent to improve his spirits he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever and after seeing him emma thus moralised to herself i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly it depends upon the character of those who handle it mr knightley he is _not_ a trifling silly young man if he were he would have done this differently he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again and for a longer time than hitherto of judging of his general manners and by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air and of fancying what the observations of all those might be who were now seeing them together for the first time she meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at mr cole s and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr cole her father s comfort was amply secured mrs bates as well as mrs goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty before she left the house was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all the amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling self denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal she had provided a plentiful dinner for them she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it she followed another carriage to mr cole s door and was pleased to see that it was mr knightley s for mr knightley keeping no horses having little spare money and a great deal of health activity and independence was too apt in emma s opinion to get about as he could and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out this is coming as you should do said she like a gentleman i am quite glad to see you he thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing room i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner yes i should i am sure i should there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them you think you carry it off very well i dare say but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances _now_ you have nothing to try for you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed you are not striving to look taller than any body else _now_ i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you nonsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr knightley she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated by her and as she firmly believed not without some dexterity on his side the party was rather large as it included one other family a proper unobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance and the male part of mr cox s family the lawyer of highbury the less worthy females were to come in the evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general and while politics and mr elton were talked over emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was the name of jane fairfax mrs cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting she listened and found it well worth listening to that very dear part of emma her fancy received an amusing supply mrs cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte a very elegant looking instrument not a grand but a large sized square pianoforte and the substance of the story the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry and congratulations on her side and explanations on miss bates s was that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood s the day before to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece entirely unexpected that at first by miss bates s account jane herself was quite at a loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it but now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter of course it must be from colonel campbell one can suppose nothing else added mrs cole and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present they might chuse to surprize her mrs cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way and still listen to mrs cole i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with i was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs cole s turned to frank churchill why do you smile said she nay why do you me i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell s being so rich and so liberal it is a handsome present very i rather wonder that it was never made before perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs bates s house you may _say_ what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine i do not know i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question if colonel campbell is not the person who can be what do you say to mrs dixon mrs dixon very true indeed i had not thought of mrs dixon she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s it is mrs dixon i dare say i told you that your suspicions would guide mine if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _mr_ dixon in them mr dixon very well yes i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr and mrs dixon we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained before i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excuse in the summer it might have passed but what can any body s native air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in her s i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are and upon my word they have an air of great probability mr dixon s preference of her music to her friend s i can answer for being very decided and then he saved her life did you ever hear of that a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard he caught her he did i was there one of the party were you really well but you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you if i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught her it was the work of a moment and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries the conversation was here interrupted they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored emma said the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells no i am sure it is not from the campbells miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr dixon is a principal in the business indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love there was no occasion to press the matter farther the conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it she said no more other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other nothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes the ladies had not been long in the drawing room before the other ladies in their different divisions arrived emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection there she sat and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding to be in company nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour jane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with harriet very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved yes of having loved even mr elton in vain by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance but by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend colonel campbell mrs weston kind hearted and musical was particularly interested by the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask and to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the fair heroine s countenance they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the early was frank churchill in he walked the first and the handsomest and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle where sat miss woodhouse and till he could find a seat by her would not sit at all emma divined what every body present must be thinking she was his object and every body must perceive it she introduced him to her friend miss smith and at convenient moments afterwards heard what each thought of the other he had never seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her naïveté and she only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment but she did think there were some looks a little like mr elton emma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room hated sitting long was always the first to move when he could that his father mr knightley mr cox and mr cole were left very busy over parish business that as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogether thought it so abundant in agreeable families that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe and the sort and could make out from his answers that as far as enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings were among a range of great families none very near and that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even chance that mrs churchill were not in health and spirits for going that they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address _at_ _times_ that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance for a night she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury taken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked his importance at enscombe was very evident he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing one of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned he had wanted very much to go abroad had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel but she would not hear of it this had happened the year before _now_ he said he was beginning to have no longer the same wish the unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father i have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause i have been here a week to morrow half my time i never knew days fly so fast a week to morrow and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others i hate the recollection perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be seen the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to mr cole when mr cole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite what is the matter said she he started thank you for rousing me he replied i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that i cannot keep my eyes from her i never saw any thing so outrée those curls this must be a fancy of her own i see nobody else looking like her i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i yes i will i declare i will and you shall see how she takes it whether she colours he was gone immediately and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing before he could return to his chair it was taken by mrs weston this is the luxury of a large party said she one can get near every body and say every thing my dear emma i am longing to talk to you i have been making discoveries and forming plans just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh do you know how miss bates and her niece came here how they were invited were not they oh yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming they walked i conclude how else could they come very true well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now and as i looked at her though i never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure nobody was ever so fortunate as herself but with many many thanks there was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightley s carriage had brought and was to take them home again i was quite surprized very glad i am sure but really quite surprized such a very kind attention and so thoughtful an attention the sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them very likely said emma nothing more likely i know no man more likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thing to do any thing really good natured useful considerate or benevolent he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering jane fairfax s ill health would appear a case of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley i know he had horses to day for we arrived together and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray well said mrs weston smiling you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again the more i think of it the more probable it appears in short i have made a match between mr knightley and jane fairfax see the consequence of keeping you company what do you say to it mr knightley and jane fairfax exclaimed emma dear mrs weston how could you think of such a thing mr knightley mr knightley must not marry you would not have little henry cut out from donwell oh no no henry must have donwell i cannot at all consent to mr knightley s marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely i am amazed that you should think of such a thing my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it i do not want the match i do not want to injure dear little henry but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henry s account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter yes i would i could not bear to have henry supplanted mr knightley marry no i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now and jane fairfax too of all women nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well know but the imprudence of such a match i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention his good nature his humanity as i tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses he has a great regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax and is always glad to shew them attention my dear mrs weston do not take to match making you do it very ill jane fairfax mistress of the abbey oh no no every feeling revolts for his own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing imprudent if you please but not mad excepting inequality of fortune and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable but mr knightley does not want to marry i am sure he has not the least idea of it do not put it into his head why should he marry he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brother s children he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax nonsense he does not care about jane fairfax in the way of love i am sure he does not he would do any good to her or her family but well said mrs weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane such a respectable home if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him to have her haunting the abbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane so very kind and obliging but he always had been such a very kind neighbour and then fly off through half a sentence to her mother s old petticoat not that it was such a very old petticoat either for still it would last a great while and indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong for shame emma do not mimic her you divert me against my conscience and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates little things do not irritate him she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does i have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her his anxiety about her health his concern that she should have no happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells may it not be from mr knightley i cannot help suspecting him i think he is just the person to do it even without being in love then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do mr knightley does nothing mysteriously i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner you take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have many a time reproached me with doing i see no sign of attachment i believe nothing of the pianoforte and proof only shall convince me that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax they combated the point some time longer in the same way emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs weston was the most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation and at the same moment mr cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs weston she had been seeing nothing except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax followed mr cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as in every respect it suited emma best to lead she gave a very proper compliance she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany her own voice well one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize a second slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual followed he was accused of having a delightful voice and a perfect knowledge of music which was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter and had no voice at all roundly asserted they sang together once more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own with mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument to listen frank churchill sang again they had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth but the sight of mr knightley among the most attentive soon drew away half emma s mind and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs weston s suspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions her objections to mr knightley s marrying did not in the least subside she could see nothing but evil in it it would be a great disappointment to mr john knightley consequently to isabella a real injury to the children a most mortifying change and material loss to them all a very great deduction from her father s daily comfort and as to herself she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey a mrs knightley for them all to give way to no mr knightley must never marry little henry must remain the heir of donwell presently mr knightley looked back and came and sat down by her they talked at first only of the performance his admiration was certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs weston it would not have struck her as a sort of touchstone however she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put to for such a purpose quite out of the question quite out of the question he replied but you must often wish it i am sure and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step this present from the campbells said she this pianoforte is very kindly given yes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment but they would have done better had they given her notice of it surprizes are foolish things the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment whether there were no actual preference remained a little longer doubtful towards the end of jane s second song her voice grew thick that will do said he when it was hed thinking aloud you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet another song however was soon begged for one more they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling the strength of the song falls on the second mr knightley grew angry that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice this must not be and touching miss bates who at that moment passed near miss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere they have no mercy on her miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing originating nobody exactly knew where was so effectually promoted by mr and mrs cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space mrs weston capital in her country dances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr knightley this would be a trial he was no dancer in general if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something there was no immediate appearance no he was talking to mrs cole he was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else and he was still talking to mrs cole emma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment not more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a partner they were a couple worth looking at two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed it was growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home on her mother s account after some attempts therefore to be permitted to begin again they were obliged to thank mrs weston look sorrowful and have done perhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma to her carriage i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after yours chapter ix emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity she must have delighted the coles worthy people who deserved to be made happy and left a name behind her that would not soon die away perfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were two points on which she was not quite easy she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfax s feelings to frank churchill it was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax and there she had no doubt she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half she was then interrupted by harriet s coming in and if harriet s praise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted oh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax don t class us together harriet my playing is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshine oh dear i think you play the best of the two i think you play quite as well as she does i am sure i had much rather hear you every body last night said how well you played those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfax s is much beyond it well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution ah but jane fairfax has them both harriet are you sure i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any taste nobody talked about it and i hate italian singing there is no understanding a word of it besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family how did you think the coxes looked just as they always do very vulgar they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its producing mr elton they told me that mr martin dined with them last saturday oh he came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to dinner oh they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox i do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there he sat by her at dinner miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him very likely i think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in highbury harriet had business at ford s emma thought it most prudent to go with her another accidental meeting with the martins was possible and in her present state would be dangerous harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always very long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusement much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury mr perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting himself in at the office door mr cole s carriage horses returning from exercise or a stray letter boy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling children round the baker s little bow window eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door a mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see nothing that does not answer she looked down the randalls road the scene enlarged two persons appeared mrs weston and her son in law they were walking into highbury to hartfield of course they were stopping however in the first place at mrs bates s whose house was a little nearer randalls than ford s and had all but knocked when emma caught their eye immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterday s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting mrs weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses in order to hear the new instrument for my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised miss bates last night that i would come this morning i was not aware of it myself i did not know that i had fixed a day but as he says i did i am going now and while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope said frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfield if you are going home mrs weston was disappointed i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased me i should be quite in the way but perhaps i may be equally in the way here miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping she says i fidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same what am i to do i am here on no business of my own said emma i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument well if you advise it but with a smile if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood i do not believe any such thing replied emma i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfax s opinion last night do come with me said mrs weston if it be not very disagreeable to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterwards we will follow them to hartfield i really wish you to call with me it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you meant it he could say no more and with the hope of hartfield to reward him returned with mrs weston to mrs bates s door emma watched them in and then joined harriet at the interesting counter trying with all the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon be it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern at last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel should i send it to mrs goddard s ma am asked mrs ford yes no yes to mrs goddard s only my pattern gown is at hartfield no you shall send it to hartfield if you please but then mrs goddard will want to see it and i could take the pattern gown home any day but i shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to hartfield at least the ribbon you could make it into two parcels mrs ford could not you it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels no more it is no trouble in the world ma am said the obliging mrs ford oh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one then if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddard s i do not know no i think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night what do you advise that you do not give another half second to the subject to hartfield if you please mrs ford aye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddard s voices approached the shop or rather one voice and two ladies mrs weston and miss bates met them at the door my dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith how do you do miss smith very well i thank you and i begged mrs weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are very well i am much obliged to you my mother is delightfully well and jane caught no cold last night how is mr woodhouse i am so glad to hear such a good account mrs weston told me you were here oh then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother will be so very happy to see her and now we are such a nice party she cannot refuse aye pray do said mr frank churchill miss woodhouse s opinion of the instrument will be worth having but said i i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me oh said he wait half a minute till i have hed my job for would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my mother s spectacles the rivet came out you know this morning so very obliging for my mother had no use of her spectacles could not put them on and by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed jane said so i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing then another there is no saying what you know at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping oh said i patty do not come with your bad news to me here is the rivet of your mistress s spectacles out then the baked apples came home mrs wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and obliging to us the wallises always i have heard some people say that mrs wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them and it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know only three of us besides dear jane at present and she really eats nothing makes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it i dare not let my mother know how little she eats so i say one thing and then i say another and it passes off but about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry i happened to meet him in the street not that i had any doubt before i have so often heard mr woodhouse recommend a baked apple i believe it is the only way that mr woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome we have apple dumplings however very often patty makes an excellent apple dumpling well mrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will oblige us emma would be very happy to wait on mrs bates c and they did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss bates than how do you do mrs ford i beg your pardon i did not see you before i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town jane came back delighted yesterday thank ye the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in what was i talking of said she beginning again when they were all in the street emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of oh my mother s spectacles so very obliging of mr frank churchill oh said he i do think i can fasten the rivet i like a job of this kind excessively which you know shewed him to be so very indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly he seems every thing the fondest parent could oh said he i can fasten the rivet i like a job of that sort excessively i never shall forget his manner and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some oh said he directly there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finest looking home baked apples i ever saw in my life that you know was so very and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from donwell some of mr knightley s most liberal supply he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees i believe there is two of them my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days but i was really quite shocked the other day for mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock i am sure you must be said he and i will send you another supply for i have a great many more than i can ever use william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year i will send you some more before they get good for nothing so i begged he would not for really as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left it was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with me no i should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had he had brought them all and now his master had not one left to bake or boil william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his master s profit than any thing but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple tart this spring he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs hodges _would_ be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed i would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for the world he would be so very i wanted to keep it from jane s knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was aware miss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good will pray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase rather darker and narrower than one could wish miss smith pray take care miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you hit your foot miss smith the step at the turning chapter x the appearance of the little sitting room as they entered was tranquillity itself mrs bates deprived of her usual employment slumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table near her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again this is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated you find me trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed what said mrs weston have not you hed it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate i have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe you see we have been wedging one leg with paper this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home he contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again that she was not immediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance and emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to mrs weston had been delighted before and was delighted again emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill with a smile at emma the person has not chosen ill i heard a good deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself do not you think so jane did not look round she was not obliged to hear mrs weston had been speaking to her at the same moment it is not fair said emma in a whisper mine was a random guess do not distress her he shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy soon afterwards he began again how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion miss fairfax i dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instrument s coming to hand do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences he paused she could not but hear she could not avoid answering till i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice of forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence it must be all conjecture conjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at all your real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word miss fairfax said something about conjecturing there it is done i have the pleasure madam to mrs bates of restoring your spectacles healed for the present he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night let me live them over again you did not enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time i believe you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds all the worlds one ever has to give for another half hour she played what felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something else he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning to emma said here is something quite new to me do you know it cramer and here are a new set of irish melodies that from such a quarter one might expect this was all sent with the instrument very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not it he knew miss fairfax could have no music here i honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart nothing hastily done nothing incomplete true affection only could have prompted it emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her this amiable upright perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together emma took the opportunity of whispering you speak too plain she must understand you i hope she does i would have her understand me i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways leave shame to her if she does wrong she ought to feel it she is not entirely without it i think i do not see much sign of it she is playing _robin_ _adair_ at this moment _his_ favourite shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window descried mr knightley on horse back not far off mr knightley i declare i must speak to him if possible just to thank him i will not open the window here it would give you all cold but i can go into my mother s room you know i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here quite delightful to have you all meet so our little room so honoured she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called mr knightley s attention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment how d ye do how d ye do very well i thank you so obliged to you for the carriage last night we were just in time my mother just ready for us pray come in do come in you will find some friends here so began miss bates and mr knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say how is your niece miss bates i want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece how is miss fairfax i hope she caught no cold last night how is she to day tell me how miss fairfax is and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else the listeners were amused and mrs weston gave emma a look of particular meaning but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism so obliged to you so very much obliged to you for the carriage resumed miss bates he cut her short with i am going to kingston can i do any thing for you oh dear kingston are you mrs cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston mrs cole has servants to send can i do any thing for _you_ no i thank you but do come in who do you think is here miss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte do put up your horse at the crown and come in well said he in a deliberating manner for five minutes perhaps and here is mrs weston and mr frank churchill too quite delightful so many friends no not now i thank you i could not stay two minutes i must get on to kingston as fast as i can oh do come in they will be so very happy to see you no no your room is full enough i will call another day and hear the pianoforte well i am so sorry oh mr knightley what a delightful party last night how extremely pleasant did you ever see such dancing was not it delightful miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill i never saw any thing equal to it oh very delightful indeed i can say nothing less for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too i think miss fairfax dances very well and mrs weston is the very best country dance player without exception in england now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return but i cannot stay to hear it oh mr knightley one moment more something of consequence so shocked jane and i are both so shocked about the apples what is the matter now to think of your sending us all your store apples you said you had a great many and now you have not one left we really are so shocked mrs hodges may well be angry william larkins mentioned it here you should not have done it indeed you should not ah he is off he never can bear to be thanked but i thought he would have staid now and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned well returning to the room i have not been able to succeed mr knightley cannot stop he is going to kingston he asked me if he could do any thing yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing oh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud you must have heard every thing to be sure can i do any thing for you at kingston said he so i just mentioned oh miss woodhouse must you be going you seem but just come so very obliging of you emma found it really time to be at home the visit had already lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that mrs weston and her companion taking leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls chapter xi it may be possible to do without dancing entirely instances have been known of young people passing many many months successively without being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue either to body or mind but when a beginning is made when the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly felt it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again and the last half hour of an evening which mr woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject frank s was the first idea and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax and even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aids of vanity to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr weston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest his first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr cole s should be hed there that the same party should be collected and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence mr weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and mrs weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five had been repeated many times over and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room but soon it came to be on one side but will there be good room for five couple i really do not think there will on another and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it it will not do to _invite_ five couple it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment somebody said that _miss_ gilbert was expected at her brother s and must be invited with the rest somebody else believed _mrs_ gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had been asked a word was put in for a second young cox and at last mr weston naming one family of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other might not they use both rooms and dance across the passage it seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better emma said it would be awkward mrs weston was in distress about the supper and mr woodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of health it made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in oh no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong she would catch a dreadful cold so would poor little harriet so you would all mrs weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them talk of it that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately he does not think of the draught i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing mrs weston was sorry for such a charge she knew the importance of it and said every thing in her power to do it away every door was now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again and with such good will on frank churchill s part that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten we were too magnificent said he we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well emma demurred it would be a crowd a sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in very true he gravely replied it was very bad but still he went on measuring and still he ended with i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple no no said she you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room there is no denying it he replied i agree with you exactly a crowd in a little room miss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words exquisite quite exquisite still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up it would be a disappointment to my father and altogether i do not know that i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self willed and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave the rest had she intended ever to _marry_ him it might have been worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference and the character of his temper but for all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my father s little rooms i bring a new proposal on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your approbation to be acted upon may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn the crown yes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls it is his own idea mrs weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied this is what we all feel oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferable dreadful i felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield is not it a good exchange you consent i hope you consent it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully comprehended and then being quite new farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable no he thought it very far from an improvement a very bad plan much worse than the other a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited if they must dance they had better dance at randalls he had never been in the room at the crown in his life did not know the people who kept it by sight oh no a very bad plan they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere i was going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body s catching cold so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could sir said mr woodhouse rather warmly you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s house from the very circumstance of its being larger sir we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all not once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief open the windows but surely mr churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls nobody could be so imprudent i never heard of such a thing dancing with open windows i am sure neither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it ah sir but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window curtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected i have often known it done myself have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done but unfortunately sir my time is so limited oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles if _miss_ _taylor_ undertakes to wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perry s great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones have the measles she will send for perry my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment said frank churchill examining the capabilities of the house i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot i was desired to say so from both it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there they can do nothing satisfactorily without you emma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young people set off together without delay for the crown there were mr and mrs weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and very happy in their different way she in some little distress and he finding every thing perfect emma said she this paper is worse than i expected look in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined my dear you are too particular said her husband what does all that signify you will see nothing of it by candlelight it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight we never see any thing of it on our club nights the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never know when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain it regarded a supper room at the time of the ballroom s being built suppers had not been in question and a small card room adjoining was the only addition what was to be done this card room would be wanted as a card room now or if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable supper another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it this made a difficulty mrs weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper mrs weston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches c set out in the little room but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion a private dance without sitting down to supper was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women and mrs weston must not speak of it again she then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed i do not think it _is_ so very small we shall not be many you know and mr weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through the passage was calling out you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs i wish said mrs weston one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be yes very true cried frank very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us well if you please said mrs weston rather hesitating if you think she will be of any use you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in consulting miss bates but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk and i need not bring the whole family you know here mr weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it his decided approbation aye do frank go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at once she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties fetch miss bates we are growing a little too nice she is a standing lesson of how to be happy but fetch them both invite them both both sir can the old lady the old lady no the young lady to be sure i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece oh i beg your pardon sir i did not immediately recollect undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both and away he ran long before he reappeared attending the short neat brisk moving aunt and her elegant niece mrs weston like a sweet tempered woman and a good wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before indeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision all the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth all the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs weston and mrs stokes every body invited was certainly to come frank had already written to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight which could not possibly be refused and a delightful dance it was to be most cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must as a counsellor she was not wanted but as an approver a much safer character she was truly welcome her approbation at once general and minute warm and incessant could not but please and for another half hour they were all walking to and fro between the different rooms some suggesting some attending and all in happy enjoyment of the future the party did not break up without emma s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing mr weston whisper to his wife he has asked her my dear that s right i knew he would chapter xii one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill s stay in surry for in spite of mr weston s confidence she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight but this was not judged feasible the preparations must take their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they must be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertainty at the risk in her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain enscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word his wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was not opposed all was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another emma being now certain of her ball began to adopt as the next vexation mr knightley s provoking indifference about it either because he did not dance himself or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording him any future amusement to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply than very well if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me oh yes i must be there i could not refuse and i will keep as much awake as i can but i would rather be at home looking over william larkins s week s account much rather i confess pleasure in seeing dancing not i indeed i never look at it i do not know who does fine dancing i believe like virtue must be its own reward those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different this emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree it made her animated open hearted she voluntarily said oh miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball what a disappointment it would be i do look forward to it i own with _very_ great pleasure it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins no she was more and more convinced that mrs weston was quite mistaken in that surmise there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side but no love alas there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over throw of every thing a letter arrived from mr churchill to urge his nephew s instant return mrs churchill was unwell far too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note from mrs weston instantly as to his going it was inevitable he must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance he knew her illnesses they never occurred but for her own convenience mrs weston added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon this wretched note was the finale of emma s breakfast when once it had been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim the loss of the ball the loss of the young man and all that the young man might be feeling it was too wretched such a delightful evening as it would have been every body so happy and she and her partner the happiest i said it would be so was the only consolation her father s feelings were quite distinct he thought principally of mrs churchill s illness and wanted to know how she was treated and as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed but they would all be safer at home emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared but if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it his dejection was most evident he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say of all horrid things leave taking is the worst but you will come again said emma this will not be your only visit to randalls ah shaking his head the uncertainty of when i may be able to return i shall try for it with a zeal it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring but i am afraid they did not stir last spring i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever our poor ball must be quite given up ah that ball why did we wait for any thing why not seize the pleasure at once how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation you told us it would be so oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance i would much rather have been merry than wise if i can come again we are still to have our ball my father depends on it do not forget your engagement emma looked graciously such a fortnight as it has been he continued every day more precious and more delightful than the day before every day making me less fit to bear any other place happy those who can remain at highbury as you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first do not we rather surpass your expectations i am sure we do i am sure you did not much expect to like us you would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury he laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment emma was convinced that it had been so and you must be off this very morning yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and i must be off immediately i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates how unlucky miss bates s powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours yes i _have_ called there passing the door i thought it better it was a right thing to do i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss bates s being absent she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may that one _must_ laugh at but that one would not wish to slight it was better to pay my visit then he hesitated got up walked to a window in short said he perhaps miss woodhouse i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts she hardly knew what to say it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious which she did not wish forcing herself to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then he was silent she believed he was looking at her probably reflecting on what she had said and trying to understand the manner she heard him sigh it was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh he could not believe her to be encouraging him a few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and in a more determined manner said it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield my regard for hartfield is most warm he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed he was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance mr woodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made him composed a very few minutes more however completed the present trial mr weston always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that was doubtful said it was time to go and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree to take leave i shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you i have engaged mrs weston to correspond with me she has been so kind as to promise it oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really interested in the absent she will tell me every thing in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again a very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest good bye closed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill short had been the notice short their meeting he was gone and emma felt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too much it was a sad change they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks indescribable spirit the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners it had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days to complete every other recommendation he had _almost_ told her that he loved her what strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to was another point but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself and this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him in spite of every previous determination against it i certainly must said she this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not for a few weeks at least well evil to some is always good to others i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes mr knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness he could not say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable kindness added you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck it was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet her composure was odious she had been particularly unwell however suffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare that had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have attended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill health chapter xiii emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love her ideas only varied as to the how much at first she thought it was a good deal and afterwards but little she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr and mrs weston she was very often thinking of him and quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring but on the other hand she could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed for employment than usual she was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_ their affection was always to subside into friendship every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting but still they were to part when she became sensible of this it struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father never to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings i do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_ said she in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to making a sacrifice i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness so much the better i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do i am quite enough in love i should be sorry to be more upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings _he_ is undoubtedly very much in love every thing denotes it very much in love indeed and when he comes again if his affection continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been different still however i must be on my guard this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy his feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved i shall do very well again after a little while and then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall have been let off easily when his letter to mrs weston arrived emma had the perusal of it and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had undervalued their strength it was a long well written letter giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the language of real feeling towards mrs weston and the transition from highbury to enscombe the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety the charm of her own name was not wanting _miss_ _woodhouse_ appeared more than once and never without a something of pleasing connexion either a compliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said and in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words i had not a spare moment on tuesday as you know for miss woodhouse s beautiful little friend pray make my excuses and adieus to her this emma could not doubt was all for herself harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated mrs churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for coming to randalls again gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned to mrs weston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her her intentions were unchanged her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness his recollection of harriet and the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the idea of harriet s succeeding her in his affections was it impossible no harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour for harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed i must not dwell upon it said she i must not think of it i know the danger of indulging such speculations but stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet s behalf though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil in that quarter was at hand as frank churchill s arrival had succeeded mr elton s engagement in the conversation of highbury as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now upon frank churchill s disappearance mr elton s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form his wedding day was named he would soon be among them again mr elton and his bride there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before mr elton and his bride was in every body s mouth and frank churchill was forgotten emma grew sick at the sound she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr elton and harriet s mind she had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength with mr weston s ball in view at least there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach new carriage bell ringing and all poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give emma felt that she could not do too much for her that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions the same harriet listened submissively and said it was very true it was just as miss woodhouse described it was not worth while to think about them and she would not think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and the next half hour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before at last emma attacked her on another ground your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it i assure you deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation emma continued i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i have been pressing on you they are very important and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse whom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while and when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been such expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well nor valued her affection so highly before there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to herself there is nothing to be compared to it warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved which gives isabella all her popularity i have it not but i know how to prize and respect it harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives dear harriet i would not change you for the clearest headed longest sighted best judging female breathing oh the coldness of a jane fairfax harriet is worth a hundred such and for a wife a sensible man s wife it is invaluable i mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet chapter xiv mrs elton was first seen at church but though devotion might be interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty or not pretty at all emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of harriet s going with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible she could not enter the house again could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to lace up her boot without _recollecting_ a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur compliments charades and horrible blunders and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent the visit was of course short and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the nothing meaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing she did not really like her she would not be in a hurry to find fault but she suspected that there was no elegance ease but not elegance she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there was too much ease her person was rather good her face not unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant emma thought at least it would turn out so as for mr elton his manners did not appear but no she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it the woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes and the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own good sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly and as little really easy as could be well miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted the house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin well miss woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her is not she very charming there was a little hesitation in emma s answer oh yes very a very pleasing young woman i think her beautiful quite beautiful very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love oh no there is nothing to surprize one at all a pretty fortune and she came in his way i dare say returned harriet sighing again i dare say she was very much attached to him perhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have yes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again he is just as superior as ever but being married you know it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves happy creature he called her augusta how delightful when the visit was returned emma made up her mind she could then see more and judge better from harriet s happening not to be at hartfield and her father s being present to engage mr elton she had a quarter of an hour of the lady s conversation to herself and could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs elton was a vain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance that she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which had been formed in a bad school pert and familiar that all her notions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living that if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would certainly do mr elton no good harriet would have been a better match if not wise or refined herself she would have connected him with those who were but miss hawkins it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best of her own set the rich brother in law near bristol was the pride of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother mr suckling s seat a comparison of hartfield to maple grove the grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty and the house was modern and well built mrs elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or imagine very like maple grove indeed she was quite struck by the likeness that room was the very shape and size of the morning room at maple grove her sister s favourite room mr elton was appealed to was not it astonishingly like she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove and the staircase you know as i came in i observed how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house i really could not help exclaiming i assure you miss woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove i have spent so many happy months there with a little sigh of sentiment a charming place undoubtedly every body who sees it is struck by its beauty but to me it has been quite a home whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony emma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient for mrs elton who only wanted to be talking herself so extremely like maple grove and it is not merely the house the grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand very much in the same way just across the lawn and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in mind my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style emma doubted the truth of this sentiment she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth while to attack an error so double dyed and therefore only said in reply when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties oh yes i am quite aware of that it is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry no i fancy not replied mrs elton with a most satisfied smile i never heard any county but surry called so emma was silenced my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest continued mrs elton and that will be our time for exploring while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say they will have their barouche landau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of _our_ carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well they would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau it will be so very much preferable when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond of exploring we explored to king s weston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche landau you have many parties of that kind here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer no not immediately here we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort nobody can be more devoted to home than i am i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol i really cannot get this girl to move from the house i absolutely must go in by myself though i hate being stuck up in the barouche landau without a companion but augusta i believe with her own good will would never stir beyond the park paling many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse looking towards mr woodhouse your father s state of health must be a great drawback why does not he try bath indeed he should let me recommend bath to you i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr woodhouse good my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now ah that s a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give in my bath life i have seen such instances of it and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to mr woodhouse s spirits which i understand are sometimes much depressed and as to its recommendations to _you_ i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite the idea of her being indebted to mrs elton for what was called an _introduction_ of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs elton s probably some vulgar dashing widow who with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live the dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have given and only thanked mrs elton coolly but their going to bath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father and then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the subject directly i do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton upon these occasions a lady s character generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer oh no indeed i must protest against any such idea a superior performer very far from it i assure you consider from how partial a quarter your information came i am doatingly fond of music passionately fond and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got into i absolutely cannot do without music it is a necessary of life to me and having always been used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice i honestly said as much to mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house too knowing what i had been accustomed to of course he was not wholly without apprehension when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that _the_ _world_ i could give up parties balls plays for i had no fear of retirement blessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to _me_ i could do very well without it to those who had no resources it was a different thing but my resources made me quite independent and as to smaller sized rooms than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments but said i to be quite honest i do not think i can live without something of a musical society i condition for nothing else but without music life would be a blank to me we cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in highbury and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head i am delighted to find myself in such a circle i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours will not it be a good plan if _we_ exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know there is a sad story against them in general they are but too apt to give up music but you who are so extremely fond of it there can be no danger surely i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance i tremble selina has entirely given up music never touches the instrument though she played sweetly and the same may be said of mrs jeffereys clara partridge that was and of the two milmans now mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright i used to be quite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper but every thing of that kind said emma will soon be in so regular a train well said mrs elton laughing we shall see emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and after a moment s pause mrs elton chose another subject we have been calling at randalls said she and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be i like them extremely mr weston seems an excellent creature quite a first rate favourite with me already i assure you and _she_ appears so truly good there is something so motherly and kind hearted about her that it wins upon one directly she was your governess i think emma was almost too much astonished to answer but mrs elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very lady like but she is really quite the gentlewoman mrs weston s manners said emma were always particularly good their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman and who do you think came in while we were there emma was quite at a loss the tone implied some old acquaintance and how could she possibly guess knightley continued mrs elton knightley himself was not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr e s i had a great curiosity my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman like man happily it was now time to be gone they were off and emma could breathe insufferable woman was her immediate exclamation worse than i had supposed absolutely insufferable knightley i could not have believed it knightley never seen him in her life before and call him knightley and discover that he is a gentleman a little upstart vulgar being with her mr e and her _caro_ _sposo_ and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery actually to discover that mr knightley is a gentleman i doubt whether he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady i could not have believed it and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club one would fancy we were bosom friends and mrs weston astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman worse and worse i never met with her equal much beyond my hopes harriet is disgraced by any comparison oh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here how angry and how diverted he would be ah there i am thinking of him directly always the first person to be thought of how i catch myself out frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind all this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons departure and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too quick a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor however she seems a very obliging pretty behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife though i think he had better not have married i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i _should_ in the course of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane i dare say your apologies were accepted sir mr elton knows you yes but a young lady a bride i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible it was being very deficient but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ it ought to be no recommendation to _you_ it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady and a bride especially is never to be neglected more is avowedly due to _her_ a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies my dear you do not understand me this is a matter of mere common politeness and good breeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry emma had done her father was growing nervous and could not understand _her_ her mind returned to mrs elton s offences and long very long did they occupy her chapter xv emma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill opinion of mrs elton her observation had been pretty correct such as mrs elton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared whenever they met again self important presuming familiar ignorant and ill bred she had a little beauty and a little accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as mrs elton s consequence only could surpass there was no reason to suppose mr elton thought at all differently from his wife he seemed not merely happy with her but proud he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury as not even miss woodhouse could equal and the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging following the lead of miss bates s good will or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied so that mrs elton s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed in one respect mrs elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first her feelings altered towards emma offended probably by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant and though the effect was agreeable the ill will which produced it was necessarily increasing emma s dislike her manners too and mr elton s were unpleasant towards harriet they were sneering and negligent emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet s cure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much it was not to be doubted that poor harriet s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own share in the story under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been given also she was of course the object of their joint dislike when they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet mrs elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax and from the first not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration but without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and befriend her before emma had forfeited her confidence and about the third time of their meeting she heard all mrs elton s knight errantry on the subject jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse i quite rave about jane fairfax a sweet interesting creature so mild and ladylike and with such talents i assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point oh she is absolutely charming you will laugh at my warmth but upon my word i talk of nothing but jane fairfax and her situation is so calculated to affect one miss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her we must bring her forward such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its fragrance on the desert air we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax i cannot think there is any danger of it was emma s calm answer and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax s situation and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs campbell i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown oh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end and i think she feels it i am sure she does she is very timid and silent one can see that she feels the want of encouragement i like her the better for it i must confess it is a recommendation to me i am a great advocate for timidity and i am sure one does not often meet with it but in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing oh i assure you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than i can express you appear to feel a great deal but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax s acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act you and i need not be afraid if _we_ set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations _we_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked _more_ than jane fairfax to partake of it i have no idea of that sort of thing it is not likely that i _should_ considering what i have been used to my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling in income however my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax i shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties poor jane fairfax thought emma you have not deserved this you may have done wrong with regard to mr dixon but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited the kindness and protection of mrs elton jane fairfax and jane fairfax heavens let me not suppose that she dares go about emma woodhouse ing me but upon my honour there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman s tongue emma had not to listen to such paradings again to any so exclusively addressed to herself so disgustingly decorated with a dear miss woodhouse the change on mrs elton s side soon afterwards appeared and she was left in peace neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs elton nor under mrs elton s guidance the very active patroness of jane fairfax and only sharing with others in a general way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done she looked on with some amusement miss bates s gratitude for mrs elton s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth she was quite one of her worthies the most amiable affable delightful woman just as accomplished and condescending as mrs elton meant to be considered emma s only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs elton as she seemed to do she heard of her walking with the eltons sitting with the eltons spending a day with the eltons this was astonishing she could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer she is a riddle quite a riddle said she to chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort and now to chuse the mortification of mrs elton s notice and the penury of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real generous affection jane had come to highbury professedly for three months the campbells were gone to ireland for three months but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there according to miss bates it all came from her mrs dixon had written most pressingly would jane but go means were to be found servants sent friends contrived no travelling difficulty allowed to exist but still she had declined it she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing this invitation was emma s conclusion she must be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself there is great fear great caution great resolution somewhere she is _not_ to be with the _dixons_ the decree is issued by somebody but why must she consent to be with the eltons here is quite a separate puzzle upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject before the few who knew her opinion of mrs elton mrs weston ventured this apology for jane we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma but it is better than being always at home her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to you are right mrs weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her emma felt that mrs weston was giving her a momentary glance and she was herself struck by his warmth with a faint blush she presently replied such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting i should not wonder said mrs weston if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and after a few minutes silence he said another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk _to_ miss fairfax as she speaks _of_ her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness i know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma little henry was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say yes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stopping it was better however to know the worst at once she hurried on and yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other mr knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together or some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered oh are you there but you are miserably behindhand mr cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago he stopped emma felt her foot pressed by mrs weston and did not herself know what to think in a moment he went on that will never be however i can assure you miss fairfax i dare say would not have me if i were to ask her and i am very sure i shall never ask her emma returned her friend s pressure with interest and was pleased enough to exclaim you are not vain mr knightley i will say that for you he seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtful and in a manner which shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax no indeed i have not you have scolded me too much for match making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you what i said just now meant nothing one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning oh no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married mr knightley was thoughtful again the result of his reverie was no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize i never had a thought of her in that way i assure you and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming young woman but not even jane fairfax is perfect she has a fault she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault well said she and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose yes very soon he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley what can she do for mr cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her mrs weston your argument weighs most with me i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over mrs elton i have no faith in mrs elton s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau jane fairfax has feeling said mr knightley i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond well mrs weston said emma triumphantly when he left them what do you say now to mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me chapter xvi every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr elton was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage dinner parties and evening parties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day i see how it is said she i see what a life i am to lead among you upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated we really seem quite the fashion if this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a disengaged day a woman with fewer resources than i have need not have been at a loss no invitation came amiss to her her bath habits made evening parties perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at the poor attempt at rout cakes and there being no ice in the highbury card parties mrs bates mrs perry mrs goddard and others were a good deal behind hand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party in which her card tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons they must not do less than others or she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable of pitiful resentment a dinner there must be after emma had talked about it for ten minutes mr woodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him the persons to be invited required little thought besides the eltons it must be the westons and mr knightley so far it was all of course and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriet s begging to be allowed to decline it she would rather not be in his company more than she could help she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable if miss woodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home it was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it possible enough for wishing she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax since her last conversation with mrs weston and mr knightley she was more conscience stricken about jane fairfax than she had often been mr knightley s words dwelt with her he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs elton which nobody else paid her this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant and it is very shameful of the same age and always knowing her i ought to have been more her friend she will never like me now i have neglected her too long but i will shew her greater attention than i have done every invitation was successful they were all disengaged and all happy the preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over a circumstance rather unlucky occurred the two eldest little knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them and staying one whole day at hartfield which one day would be the very day of this party his professional engagements did not allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so mr woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear and here would be a ninth and emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty eight hours without falling in with a dinner party she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very immaterial she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother the event was more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma john knightley came but mr weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day he might be able to join them in the evening but certainly not to dinner mr woodhouse was quite at ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the chief of even emma s vexation the day came the party were punctually assembled and mr john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax mrs elton as elegant as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silence wanting only to observe enough for isabella s information but miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could talk to her he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he said i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i am sure you must have been wet we scarcely got home in time i hope you turned directly i went only to the post office said she and reached home before the rain was much it is my daily errand i always fetch the letters when i am here it saves trouble and is a something to get me out a walk before breakfast does me good not a walk in the rain i should imagine no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out mr john knightley smiled and replied that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for there was a little blush and then this answer i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters indifferent oh no i never conceived you could become indifferent letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship i have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does ah you are not serious now i know mr john knightley too well i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body i can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a post office i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to day when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years said john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings i consider one as including the other time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle but that is not the change i had in view for you as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have it was kindly said and very far from giving offence a pleasant thank you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip a tear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh her attention was now claimed by mr woodhouse who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with her and with all his mildest urbanity said i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain young ladies should take care of themselves young ladies are delicate plants they should take care of their health and their complexion my dear did you change your stockings yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for i hope your good grand mama and aunt are well they are some of my very old friends i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour you do us a great deal of honour to day i am sure my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield the kind hearted polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy by this time the walk in the rain had reached mrs elton and her remonstrances now opened upon jane my dear jane what is this i hear going to the post office in the rain this must not be i assure you you sad girl how could you do such a thing it is a sign i was not there to take care of you jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold oh do not tell _me_ you really are a very sad girl and do not know how to take care of yourself to the post office indeed mrs weston did you ever hear the like you and i must positively exert our authority my advice said mrs weston kindly and persuasively i certainly do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year the spring i always think requires more than common care better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable you look as if you would not do such a thing again oh she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again eagerly rejoined mrs elton we will not allow her to do such a thing again and nodding significantly there must be some arrangement made there must indeed i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you that will obviate all difficulties you know and from _us_ i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation you are extremely kind said jane but i cannot give up my early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before my dear jane say no more about it the thing is determined that is laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master you know mrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled excuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant if the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am not here by my grandmama s oh my dear but so much as patty has to do and it is a kindness to employ our men jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead of answering she began speaking again to mr john knightley the post office is a wonderful establishment said she the regularity and despatch of it if one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing it is certainly very well regulated so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder the clerks grow expert from habit they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them if you want any farther explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it that is the key to a great deal of capacity the public pays and must be served well the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual observations made i have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart yes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness i know what you mean but emma s hand is the strongest isabella and emma both write beautifully said mr woodhouse and always did and so does poor mrs weston with half a sigh and half a smile at her i never saw any gentleman s handwriting emma began looking also at mrs weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs weston was attending to some one else and the pause gave her time to reflect now how am i going to introduce him am i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase your yorkshire friend your correspondent in yorkshire that would be the way i suppose if i were very bad no i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress i certainly get better and better now for it mrs weston was disengaged and emma began again mr frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw i do not admire it said mr knightley it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing this was not submitted to by either lady they vindicated him against the base aspersion no it by no means wanted strength it was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong had not mrs weston any letter about her to produce no she had heard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put it away if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writing desk i am sure i could produce a specimen i have a note of his do not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you one day he chose to say he was employed well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr knightley oh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill said mr knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best dinner was on table mrs elton before she could be spoken to was ready and before mr woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining parlour was saying must i go first i really am ashamed of always leading the way jane s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma she had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any she suspected that it _had_ that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear and that it had not been in vain she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual a glow both of complexion and spirits she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mails it was at her tongue s end but she abstained she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfax s feelings and they followed the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance of good will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each chapter xvii when the ladies returned to the drawing room after dinner emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself she and mrs weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together mrs elton left them no choice if jane repressed her for a little time she soon began again and though much that passed between them was in a half whisper especially on mrs elton s side there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects the post office catching cold fetching letters and friendship were long under discussion and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant to jane inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her and professions of mrs elton s meditated activity here is april come said she i get quite anxious about you june will soon be here but i have never fixed on june or any other month merely looked forward to the summer in general but have you really heard of nothing i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing i not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs elton who can have thought of it as i have done but you have not seen so much of the world as i have you do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove a cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle wax candles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in colonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer said jane i must spend some time with them i am sure they will want it afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present trouble aye i know your scruples you are afraid of giving me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am i shall write to mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving any body trouble but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us your inexperience really amuses me a situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moment s notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly excuse me ma am but this is by no means my intention i make no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends when i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce something offices for the sale not quite of human flesh but of human intellect oh my dear human flesh you quite shock me if you mean a fling at the slave trade i assure you mr suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition i did not mean i was not thinking of the slave trade replied jane governess trade i assure you was all that i had in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where it lies but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do something that would do repeated mrs elton aye _that_ may suit your humble ideas of yourself i know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life you are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications i think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison a gentleman s family is all that i should condition for i know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i shall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right to move in the first circle your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chose that is i do not know if you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure but you sing as well as play yes i really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you chose and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such a situation together said jane they are pretty sure to be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me i am exceedingly obliged to you mrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as i am and i am quite serious too i assure you replied mrs elton gaily in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us in this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change of object and emma heard her saying in the same half whisper to jane here comes this dear old beau of mine i protest only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men what a dear creature he is i assure you i like him excessively i admire all that quaint old fashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease modern ease often disgusts me but this good old mr woodhouse i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner oh i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous i fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown how do you like it selina s choice handsome i think but i do not know whether it is not over trimmed i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over trimmed quite a horror of finery i must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery but i am quite in the minority i believe few people seem to value simplicity of dress show and finery are every thing i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin do you think it will look well the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing room when mr weston made his appearance among them he had returned to a late dinner and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over he had been too much expected by the best judges for surprize but there was great joy mr woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now as he would have been sorry to see him before john knightley only was in mute astonishment that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london should set off again and walk half a mile to another man s house for the sake of being in mixed company till bed time of hing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply a man who had been in motion since eight o clock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alone such a man to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party john knightley looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said i could not have believed it even of _him_ mr weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere from home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding to a family communication which though principally addressed to mrs weston he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room he gave her a letter it was from frank and to herself he had met with it in his way and had taken the liberty of opening it read it read it said he it will give you pleasure only a few lines will not take you long read it to emma the two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to every body well he is coming you see good news i think well what do you say to it i always told you he would be here again soon did not i anne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe me in town next week you see at the latest i dare say for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there to morrow or saturday as to her illness all nothing of course but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again so near as town they will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us this is precisely what i wanted well pretty good news is not it have you hed it has emma read it all put it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way mrs weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion her looks and words had nothing to restrain them she was happy she knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy her congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak so fluently _she_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings and trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she rather thought was considerable mr weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already it was well that he took every body s joy for granted or he might not have thought either mr woodhouse or mr knightley particularly delighted they were the first entitled after mrs weston and emma to be made happy from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have been too positive an interruption and finding himself close to mrs elton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her chapter xviii i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you said mr weston mrs elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope smiled most graciously you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he continued and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage you are very obliging frank will be extremely happy i am sure he is to be in town next week if not sooner we have notice of it in a letter to day i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to mrs weston she is his principal correspondent i assure you i hardly ever get a letter and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston laughing affectedly i must protest against that a most dangerous precedent indeed i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves oh mr weston i could not have believed it of you aye we men are sad fellows you must take care of yourself mrs elton this letter tells us it is a short letter written in a hurry merely to give us notice it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on mrs churchill s account she has not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her so they are all to move southward without loss of time indeed from yorkshire i think enscombe is in yorkshire yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london a considerable journey yes upon my word very considerable sixty five miles farther than from maple grove to london but what is distance mr weston to people of large fortune you would be amazed to hear how my brother mr suckling sometimes flies about you will hardly believe me but twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again with four horses the evil of the distance from enscombe said mr weston is that mrs churchill _as_ _we_ _understand_ has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together in frank s last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle s this you know speaks a great degree of weakness but now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the road so frank writes word certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs elton you must grant me that no indeed i shall grant you nothing i always take the part of my own sex i do indeed i give you notice you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point i always stand up for women and i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchill s making incredible exertions to avoid it selina says it is quite horror to her and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution does mrs churchill do the same depend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did mrs churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for mrs elton eagerly interposed with oh mr weston do not mistake me selina is no fine lady i assure you do not run away with such an idea is not she then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld mrs elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it and she was considering in what way she had best retract when mr weston went on mrs churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect but this is quite between ourselves she is very fond of frank and therefore i would not speak ill of her besides she is out of health now but _that_ indeed by her own account she has always been i would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much faith in mrs churchill s illness if she is really ill why not go to bath mr weston to bath or to clifton she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe she has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change it is a retired place a fine place but very retired aye like maple grove i dare say nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life i always say a woman cannot have too many resources and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society frank was here in february for a fortnight so i remember to have heard he will find an _addition_ to the society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume to call myself an addition but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by and mr weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible not heard of you i believe mrs weston s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton he had done his duty and could return to his son when frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day s news doubly welcome it has been completely unexpected that is _i_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forth i always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next very true mr weston perfectly true it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _may_ before hymen s saffron robe would be put on for us oh the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views the carriage we had disappointments about the carriage one morning i remember he came to me quite in despair she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and mr weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on you were mentioning may may is the very month which mrs churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombe in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended now will be the time this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house i think it is so i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy mrs weston s partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me she thinks nobody equal to him and i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour i have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchill at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of him i am no flatterer mr weston was musing i hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor mrs churchill if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she was the instigator frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife s his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart only think well that must be infinitely provoking i have quite a horror of upstarts maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves your description of mrs churchill made me think of them directly people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows they came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know mr weston one has not great hopes from birmingham i always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things i assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother mr suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours it is infinitely too bad mr suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove and whose father had it before him i believe at least i am almost sure that old mr suckling had completed the purchase before his death they were interrupted tea was carrying round and mr weston having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away after tea mr and mrs weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhouse to cards the remaining five were left to their own powers and emma doubted their getting on very well for mr knightley seemed little disposed for conversation mrs elton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent mr john knightley proved more talkative than his brother he was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys but you have your sister s letter and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure my charge would be much more concise than her s and probably not much in the same spirit all that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them i rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again that is very likely you think so do not you i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately increase certainly you must be sensible that the last half year has made a great difference in your way of life difference no indeed i am not there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be witness this very time here am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner party when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it a little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr cole s or balls at the crown the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goings on is very great yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all very well and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are i only beg you to send them home no cried mr knightley that need not be the consequence let them be sent to donwell i shall certainly be at leisure upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine what have they been dining once with the coles and having a ball talked of which never took place i can understand you nodding at mr john knightley your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed but you turning to mr knightley who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts mr knightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded without difficulty upon mrs elton s beginning to talk to him volume iii chapter i a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing it was not worth thinking of but if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away it would be very distressing if a separation of two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils before her caution for him and for herself would be necessary she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state it was not very long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill s feelings the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards he rode down for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she must act they met with the utmost friendliness there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree she watched him well it was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been absence with the conviction probably of her indifference had produced this very natural and very desirable effect he was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories and he was not without agitation it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative indifference he was not calm his spirits were evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him lively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself but what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a quarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed he had not stopped he would not stop for more than a word but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off she had no doubt as to his being less in love but neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days he was often hoping intending to come but was always prevented his aunt could not bear to have him leave her such was his own account at randall s if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come it was to be inferred that mrs churchill s removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder that she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself convinced of it at randalls though much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her but he could not be prevailed on by all his father s doubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong as ever it soon appeared that london was not the place for her she could not endure its noise her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering and by the ten days end her nephew s letter to randalls communicated a change of plan they were going to remove immediately to richmond mrs churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place a ready furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends for the house was taken for may and june she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he could even wish emma saw how mr weston understood these joyous prospects he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered she hoped it was not so two months must bring it to the proof mr weston s own happiness was indisputable he was quite delighted it was the very circumstance he could have wished for now it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood what were nine miles to a young man an hour s ride he would be always coming over the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never sixteen miles nay eighteen it must be full eighteen to manchester street was a serious obstacle were he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse better than nearer one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal the ball at the crown it had not been forgotten before but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day now however it was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from frank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty four hours at any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible mr weston s ball was to be a real thing a very few to morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness mr woodhouse was resigned the time of year lightened the evil to him may was better for every thing than february mrs bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them while dear emma were gone chapter ii no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball the day approached the day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching frank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls before dinner and every thing was safe no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma the room at the crown was to witness it but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd mr weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man s company she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just sufficiently before them frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch and though he did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening they all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize so unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself by particular desire to help mr weston s judgment and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity she liked his open manners but a little less of open heartedness would have made him a higher character general benevolence but not general friendship made a man what he ought to be she could fancy such a man the whole party walked about and looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do formed a sort of half circle round the fire to observe in their various modes till other subjects were started that though _may_ a fire in the evening was still very pleasant emma found that it was not mr weston s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger they had stopped at mrs bates s door to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons frank was standing by her but not steadily there was a restlessness which shewed a mind not at ease he was looking about he was going to the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages impatient to begin or afraid of being always near her mrs elton was spoken of i think she must be here soon said he i have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much of her it cannot be long i think before she comes a carriage was heard he was on the move immediately but coming back said i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her i have never seen either mr or mrs elton i have no business to put myself forward mr and mrs elton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed but miss bates and miss fairfax said mr weston looking about we thought you were to bring them the mistake had been slight the carriage was sent for them now emma longed to know what frank s first opinion of mrs elton might be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of graciousness he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had passed in a few minutes the carriage returned somebody talked of rain i will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father miss bates must not be forgotten and away he went mr weston was following but mrs elton detained him to gratify him by her opinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of hearing a very fine young man indeed mr weston you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him you may believe me i never compliment i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approve so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them they were never tolerated at maple grove neither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better while she talked of his son mr weston s attention was chained but when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away mrs elton turned to mrs weston i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious i believe we drive faster than any body what a pleasure it is to send one s carriage for a friend i understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary you may be very sure i shall always take care of _them_ miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into the room and mrs elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs weston s to receive them her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma but her words every body s words were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not hed her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire as the door opened she was heard so very obliging of you no rain at all nothing to signify i do not care for myself quite thick shoes and jane declares well as soon as she was within the door well this is brilliant indeed this is admirable excellently contrived upon my word nothing wanting could not have imagined it so well lighted up jane jane look did you ever see any thing oh mr weston you must really have had aladdin s lamp good mrs stokes would not know her own room again i saw her as i came in she was standing in the entrance oh mrs stokes said i but i had not time for more she was now met by mrs weston very well i thank you ma am i hope you are quite well very happy to hear it so afraid you might have a headache seeing

horses a moment most comfortable carriage oh and i am sure our thanks are due to you mrs weston on that score mrs elton had most kindly sent jane a note or we should have been but two such offers in one day never were such neighbours i said to my mother upon my word ma am thank you my mother is remarkably well gone to mr woodhouse s i made her take her shawl for the evenings are not warm her large new shawl mrs dixon s wedding present so kind of her to think of my mother bought at weymouth you know mr dixon s choice there were three others jane says which they hesitated about some time colonel campbell rather preferred an olive my dear jane are you sure you did not wet your feet it was but a drop or two but i am so afraid but mr frank churchill was so extremely and there was a mat to step upon i shall never forget his extreme politeness oh mr frank churchill i must tell you my mother s spectacles have never been in fault since the rivet never came out again my mother often talks of your good nature does not she jane do not we often talk of mr frank churchill ah here s miss woodhouse dear miss woodhouse how do you do very well i thank you quite well this is meeting quite in fairy land such a transformation must not compliment i know eyeing emma most complacently that would be rude but upon my word miss woodhouse you do look how do you like jane s hair you are a judge

friends and such a noble fire i am quite roasted no coffee i thank you for me never take coffee a little tea if you please sir by and bye no hurry oh here it comes every thing so good frank churchill returned to his station by emma and as soon as miss bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little way behind her he was thoughtful whether he were overhearing too she could not determine after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken mrs elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself and it was how do you like my gown how do you like my trimming how has wright done my hair with many other relative questions all answered with patient politeness mrs elton then said nobody can think less of dress in general than i do but upon such an occasion as this when every body s eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westons who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour i would not wish to be inferior to others and i see very few pearls in the room except mine so frank churchill is a capital dancer i understand we shall see if our styles suit a fine young man certainly is frank churchill i like him very well at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear more and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while till another suspension brought mrs elton s tones again distinctly forward mr elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming oh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion i was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us jane repeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and displeasure that is easy but miss fairfax does not disapprove it i suppose how do you like mrs elton said emma in a whisper not at all you are ungrateful ungrateful what do you mean then changing from a frown to a smile no do not tell me i do not want to know what you mean where is my father when are we to begin dancing emma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour he walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both mr and mrs weston he had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before emma it had just occurred to mrs weston that mrs elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would expect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction emma heard the sad truth with fortitude and what are we to do for a proper partner for her said mr weston she will think frank ought to ask her frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect approbation of and it then appeared that mrs weston was wanting _him_ to dance with mrs elton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon mr weston and mrs elton led the way mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed emma must submit to stand second to mrs elton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her it was almost enough to make her think of marrying mrs elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill she could not lose by the change mr weston might be his son s superior in spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her she was more disturbed by mr knightley s not dancing than by any thing else there he was among the standers by where he ought not to be he ought to be dancing not classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whist players who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up so young as he looked he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere than where he had placed himself his tall firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw every body s eyes and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him he moved a few steps nearer and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner with what natural grace he must have danced would he but take the trouble whenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile but in general he was looking grave she wished he could love a ballroom better and could like frank churchill better he seemed often observing her she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner they seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable the ball proceeded pleasantly the anxious cares the incessant attentions of mrs weston were not thrown away every body seemed happy and the praise of being a delightful ball which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this of very important very recordable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually are there was one however which emma thought something of the two last dances before supper were begun and harriet had no partner the only young lady sitting down and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder but emma s wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided she was sure he would not and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card room escape however was not his plan he came to the part of the room where the sitters by were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her emma saw it she was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw it all when she was half way up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr elton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs weston and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances the kind hearted gentle mrs weston had left her seat to join him and say do not you dance mr elton to which his prompt reply was most readily mrs weston if you will dance with me me oh no i would get you a better partner than myself i am no dancer if mrs gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great pleasure i am sure for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs gilbert mrs gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing miss smith miss smith oh i had not observed you are extremely obliging and if i were not an old married man but my dancing days are over mrs weston you will excuse me any thing else i should be most happy to do at your command but my dancing days are over mrs weston said no more and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat this was mr elton the amiable obliging gentle mr elton she looked round for a moment he had joined mr knightley at a little distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife she would not look again her heart was in a glow and she feared her face might be as hot in another moment a happier sight caught her mr knightley leading harriet to the set never had she been more surprized seldom more delighted than at that instant she was all pleasure and gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be thanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could catch his eye again his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it extremely good and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles mr elton had retreated into the card room looking emma trusted very foolish she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though growing very like her _she_ spoke some of her feelings by observing audibly to her partner knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith very good natured i declare supper was announced the move began and miss bates might be heard from that moment without interruption till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon jane jane my dear jane where are you here is your tippet mrs weston begs you to put on your tippet she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done one door nailed up quantities of matting my dear jane indeed you must mr churchill oh you are too obliging how well you put it on so gratified excellent dancing indeed yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me i set off without saying a word just as i told you grandmama was quite well had a charming evening with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat and backgammon tea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners oh said i i shall not forestall jane i left her dancing with mr george otway she will love to tell you all about it herself to morrow her first partner was mr elton i do not know who will ask her next perhaps mr william cox my dear sir you are too obliging is there nobody you would not rather i am not helpless sir you are most kind upon my word jane on one arm and me on the other stop stop let us stand a little back mrs elton is going dear mrs elton how elegant she looks beautiful lace now we all follow in her train quite the queen of the evening well here we are at the passage two steps jane take care of the two steps oh no there is but one well i was persuaded there were two how very odd i was convinced there were two and there is but one i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style candles everywhere i was telling you of your grandmama jane there was a little disappointment the baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse who would be so very much concerned well this is brilliant i am all amazement could not have supposed any thing such elegance and profusion i have seen nothing like it since well where shall we sit where shall we sit anywhere so that jane is not in a draught where _i_ sit is of no consequence oh do you recommend this side well i am sure mr churchill only it seems too good but just as you please what you direct in this house cannot be wrong dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama soup too bless me i should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i cannot help beginning emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr knightley till after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked he was warm in his reprobation of mr elton s conduct it had been unpardonable rudeness and mrs elton s looks also received the due share of censure they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he emma why is it that they are your enemies he looked with smiling penetration and on receiving no answer added _she_ ought not to be angry with you i suspect whatever he may be to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet i did replied emma and they cannot forgive me he shook his head but there was a smile of indulgence with it and he only said i shall not scold you i leave you to your own reflections can you trust me with such flatterers does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong not your vain spirit but your serious spirit if one leads you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet it was through a series of strange blunders and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself harriet smith has some first rate qualities which mrs elton is totally without an unpretending single minded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs elton i found harriet more conversable than i expected emma was extremely gratified they were interrupted by the bustle of mr weston calling on every body to begin dancing again come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing come emma set your companions the example every body is lazy every body is asleep i am ready said emma whenever i am wanted whom are you going to dance with asked mr knightley she hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will ask me will you said he offering his hand indeed i will you have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper brother and sister no indeed chapter iii this little explanation with mr knightley gave emma considerable pleasure it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy she was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour was peculiarly gratifying the impertinence of the eltons which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked forward to another happy result the cure of harriet s infatuation from harriet s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom she had strong hopes it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr elton was not the superior creature she had believed him the fever was over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite harriet rational frank churchill not too much in love and mr knightley not wanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer must be before her she was not to see frank churchill this morning he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day she did not regret it having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa when the great iron sweep gate opened and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together frank churchill with harriet leaning on his arm actually harriet a moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened harriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her the iron gates and the front door were not twenty yards asunder they were all three soon in the hall and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away a young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered and surprizes be explained such events are very interesting but the suspense of them cannot last long a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole miss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at mrs goddard s who had been also at the ball had walked out together and taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public enough for safety had led them into alarm about half a mile beyond highbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them on a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies a child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on harriet to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury but poor harriet could not follow she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless and in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged to remain how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous and impertinent in look though not absolutely in word more and more frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more or to use her ill she was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving away but her terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang demanding more in this state frank churchill had found her she trembling and conditioning they loud and insolent by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond highbury and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates and to have forgotten to restore them he had been obliged to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes he was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion he had left them completely frightened and harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome it was his idea to bring her to hartfield he had thought of no other place this was the amount of the whole story of his communication and of harriet s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech he dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays left him not another minute to lose and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs goddard and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr knightley he set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself such an adventure as this a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain so emma thought at least could a linguist could a grammarian could even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other how much more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and foresight especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made it was a very extraordinary thing nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory no rencontre no alarm of the kind and now it had happened to the very person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her it certainly was very extraordinary and knowing as she did the favourable state of mind of each at this period it struck her the more he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for mr elton it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him while harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror her naïveté her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a sensibility amused and delighted and just at last after harriet s own account had been given he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms every thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled nor assisted she would not stir a step nor drop a hint no she had had enough of interference there could be no harm in a scheme a mere passive scheme it was no more than a wish beyond it she would on no account proceed emma s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible within half an hour it was known all over highbury it was the very event to engage those who talk most the young and the low and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news the last night s ball seemed lost in the gipsies poor mr woodhouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss smith were coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very indifferent which though not exactly true for she was perfectly well and harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not invent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took themselves off in a hurry the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephews in her imagination it maintained its ground and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital chapter iv a very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began miss woodhouse if you are at leisure i have something that i should like to tell you a sort of confession to make and then you know it will be over emma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak there was a seriousness in harriet s manner which prepared her quite as much as her words for something more than ordinary it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued to have no reserves with you on this subject as i am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it i do not want to say more than is necessary i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done and i dare say you understand me yes said emma i hope i do how i could so long a time be fancying myself cried harriet warmly it seems like madness i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now i do not care whether i meet him or not except that of the two i had rather not see him and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him but i do not envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her as i have done she is very charming i dare say and all that but i think her very ill tempered and disagreeable i shall never forget her look the other night however i assure you miss woodhouse i wish her no evil no let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another moment s pang and to convince you that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroy what i ought to have destroyed long ago what i ought never to have kept i know that very well blushing as she spoke however now i will destroy it all and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown cannot you guess what this parcel holds said she with a conscious look not the least in the world did he ever give you any thing no i cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have valued very much she held the parcel towards her and emma read the words _most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top her curiosity was greatly excited harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge ware box which harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of court plaister now said harriet you _must_ recollect no indeed i do not dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat just before mr and mrs john knightley came i think the very evening do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court plaister but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat my dearest harriet cried emma putting her hand before her face and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear remember it aye i remember it all now all except your saving this relic i knew nothing of that till this moment but the cutting the finger and my recommending court plaister and saying i had none about me oh my sins my sins and i had plenty all the while in my pocket one of my senseless tricks i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life well sitting down again go on what else and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake said emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement and secretly she added to herself lord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about i never was equal to this here resumed harriet turning to her box again here is something still more valuable i mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court plaister never did emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure it was the end of an old pencil the part without any lead this was really his said harriet do not you remember one morning no i dare say you do not but one morning i forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before _that_ _evening_ he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book it was about spruce beer mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment i do remember it cried emma i perfectly remember it talking about spruce beer oh yes mr knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too i perfectly remember it stop mr knightley was standing just here was not he i have an idea he was standing just here ah i do not know i cannot recollect it is very odd but i cannot recollect mr elton was sitting here i remember much about where i am now well go on oh that s all i have nothing more to shew you or to say except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see me do it my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things yes simpleton as i was but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married i knew it was but had not resolution enough to part with them but harriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister might be useful i shall be happier to burn it replied harriet it has a disagreeable look to me i must get rid of every thing there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton and when thought emma will there be a beginning of mr churchill she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had _told_ no fortune might be proved to have made harriet s about a fortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation and quite undesignedly emma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the information she received more valuable she merely said in the course of some trivial chat well harriet whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so and thought no more of it till after a minute s silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone i shall never marry emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and after a moment s debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied never marry this is a new resolution it is one that i shall never change however after another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed from i hope it is not in compliment to mr elton mr elton indeed cried harriet indignantly oh no and emma could just catch the words so superior to mr elton she then took a longer time for consideration should she proceed no farther should she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did or perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once all that she meant to say and know plain dealing was always best she had previously determined how far she would proceed on any application of the sort and it would be safer for both to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed she was decided and thus spoke harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you is not it so oh miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose indeed i am not so mad but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially i am not at all surprized at you harriet the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation the very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time when i saw him coming his noble look and my wretchedness before such a change in one moment such a change from perfect misery to perfect happiness it is very natural it is natural and it is honourable yes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully but that it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise i do not advise you to give way to it harriet i do not by any means engage for its being returned consider what you are about perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you be observant of him let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations i give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on the subject i am determined against all interference henceforward i know nothing of the matter let no name ever pass our lips we were very wrong before we will be cautious now he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity but take care of yourself i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_ is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation chapter v in this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened upon hartfield to highbury in general it brought no material change the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings and of the use to be made of their barouche landau and jane fairfax was still at her grandmother s and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able to defeat mrs elton s activity in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will mr knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike him more he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma that emma was his object appeared indisputable every thing declared it his own attentions his father s hints his mother in law s guarded silence it was all in unison words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story but while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him over to harriet mr knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax he could not understand it but there were symptoms of intelligence between them he thought so at least symptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emma s errors of imagination _she_ was not present when the suspicion first arose he was dining with the randalls family and jane at the eltons and he had seen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which from the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place when he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight myself creating what i saw brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking of private understanding even between frank churchill and jane he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at hartfield emma and harriet were going to walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the weather threatened rain mr and mrs weston and their son miss bates and her niece who had accidentally met they all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him the randalls party agreed to it immediately and after a pretty long speech from miss bates which few persons listened to she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse s most obliging invitation as they were turning into the grounds mr perry passed by on horseback the gentlemen spoke of his horse by the bye said frank churchill to mrs weston presently what became of mr perry s plan of setting up his carriage mrs weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he ever had any such plan nay i had it from you you wrote me word of it three months ago me impossible indeed you did i remember it perfectly you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon mrs perry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it it was owing to _her_ persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm you must remember it now upon my word i never heard of it till this moment never really never bless me how could it be then i must have dreamt it but i was completely persuaded miss smith you walk as if you were tired you will not be sorry to find yourself at home what is this what is this cried mr weston about perry and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you no sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it from nobody very odd i really was persuaded of mrs weston s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry it is odd though observed his father that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer i think emma was out of hearing she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of mr weston s hint why to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have i do not mean to say that he did not dream it i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed jane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed i do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were i will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed they were entering the hall mr knightley s eyes had preceded miss bates s in a glance at jane from frank churchill s face where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind and too busy with her shawl mr weston had walked in the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass mr knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye he seemed watching her intently in vain however if it were so jane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither there was no time for farther remark or explanation the dream must be borne with and mr knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use instead of the small sized pembroke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters it used to stand here where is it this is a sort of dull looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves they were rapidly forming words for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort which mr weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax she gave a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it frank was next to emma jane opposite to them and mr knightley so placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much as he could with as little apparent observation the word was discovered and with a faint smile pushed away if meant to be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across for it was not mixed and harriet eager after every fresh word and finding out none directly took it up and fell to work she was sitting by mr knightley and turned to him for help the word was _blunder_ and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a blush on jane s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible mr knightley connected it with the dream but how it could all be was beyond his comprehension how the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep he feared there must be some decided involvement disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick it was a child s play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchill s part with great indignation did he continue to observe him with great alarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions he saw a short word prepared for emma and given to her with a look sly and demure he saw that emma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure for she said nonsense for shame he heard frank churchill next say with a glance towards jane i will give it to her shall i and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth no no you must not you shall not indeed it was done however this gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it mr knightley s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was not long before he saw it to be _dixon_ jane fairfax s perception seemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters so arranged she was evidently displeased looked up and seeing herself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying only i did not know that proper names were allowed pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered her face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned towards her aunt aye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not spoken a word i was just going to say the same thing it is time for us to be going indeed the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us my dear sir you are too obliging we really must wish you good night jane s alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived she was immediately up and wanting to quit the table but so many were also moving that she could not get away and mr knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined she was afterwards looking for her shawl frank churchill was looking also it was growing dusk and the room was in confusion and how they parted mr knightley could not tell he remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full of what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist his observations he must yes he certainly must as a friend an anxious friend give emma some hint ask her some question he could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to preserve her it was his duty pray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other emma was extremely confused she could not endure to give him the true explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them oh she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves the joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you and mr churchill he had hoped she would speak again but she did not she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak he sat a little while in doubt a variety of evils crossed his mind interference fruitless interference emma s confusion and the acknowledged intimacy seemed to declare her affection engaged yet he would speak he owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter any thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause my dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly why do you make a doubt of it have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him never never she cried with a most open eagerness never for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me and how could it possibly come into your head i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them certain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public oh you amuse me excessively i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander but it will not do very sorry to check you in your first essay but indeed it will not do there is no admiration between them i do assure you and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstances feelings rather of a totally different nature it is impossible exactly to explain there is a good deal of nonsense in it but the part which is capable of being communicated which is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be that is i _presume_ it to be so on her side and i can _answer_ for its being so on his i will answer for the gentleman s indifference she spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction which silenced mr knightley she was in gay spirits and would have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers he found he could not be useful and his feelings were too much irritated for talking that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever by the fire which mr woodhouse s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon afterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey chapter vi after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr and mrs suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present in the daily interchange of news they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings coming had been united such as the last accounts of mrs churchill whose health seemed every day to supply a different report and the situation of mrs weston whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it mrs elton was very much disappointed it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade her introductions and recommendations must all wait and every projected party be still only talked of so she thought at first but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come they could go there again with them in the autumn it was settled that they should go to box hill that there was to be such a party had been long generally known it had even given the idea of another emma had never been to box hill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and mr weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from mr weston that he had been proposing to mrs elton as her brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite and go together and that as mrs elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection now as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton of which mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth bringing forward again it could not be done without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs elton s party every feeling was offended and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr weston s temper i am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably but i thought you would such schemes as these are nothing without numbers one cannot have too large a party a large party secures its own amusement and she is a good natured woman after all one could not leave her out emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private it was now the middle of june and the weather fine and mrs elton was growing impatient to name the day and settle with mr weston as to pigeon pies and cold lamb when a lame carriage horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty it might be weeks it might be only a few days before the horse were useable but no preparations could be ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation mrs elton s resources were inadequate to such an attack is not this most vexatious knightley she cried and such weather for exploring these delays and disappointments are quite odious what are we to do the year will wear away at this rate and nothing done before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston you had better explore to donwell replied mr knightley that may be done without horses come and eat my strawberries they are ripening fast if mr knightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so for his proposal was caught at with delight and the oh i should like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner donwell was famous for its strawberry beds which seemed a plea for the invitation but no plea was necessary cabbage beds would have been enough to tempt the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere she promised him again and again to come much oftener than he doubted and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it you may depend upon me said she i certainly will come name your day and i will come you will allow me to bring jane fairfax i cannot name a day said he till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you oh leave all that to me only give me a carte blanche i am lady patroness you know it is my party i will bring friends with me i hope you will bring elton said he but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations oh now you are looking very sly but consider you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_ i am no young lady on her preferment married women you know may be safely authorised it is my party leave it all to me i will invite your guests no he calmly replied there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell and that one is mrs weston i suppose interrupted mrs elton rather mortified no mrs knightley and till she is in being i will manage such matters myself ah you are an odd creature she cried satisfied to have no one preferred to herself you are a humourist and may say what you like quite a humourist well i shall bring jane with me jane and her aunt the rest i leave to you i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family don t scruple i know you are attached to them you certainly will meet them if i can prevail and i shall call on miss bates in my way home that s quite unnecessary i see jane every day but as you like it is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing i shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm here probably this basket with pink ribbon nothing can be more simple you see and jane will have such another there is to be no form or parade a sort of gipsy party we are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees and whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doors a table spread in the shade you know every thing as natural and simple as possible is not that your idea not quite my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining room the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is best observed by meals within doors when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house well as you please only don t have a great set out and by the bye can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion pray be sincere knightley if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges or to inspect anything i have not the least wish for it i thank you well but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever i will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and would spurn any body s assistance i wish we had a donkey the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys jane miss bates and me and my caro sposo walking by i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home and very long walks you know in summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt you will not find either between donwell and highbury donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry come on a donkey however if you prefer it you can borrow mrs cole s i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible that i am sure you would indeed i do you justice my good friend under that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the warmest heart as i tell mr e you are a thorough humourist yes believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme you have hit upon the very thing to please me mr knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade he wished to persuade mr woodhouse as well as emma to join the party and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill mr woodhouse must not under the specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two spent at donwell be tempted away to his misery he was invited on good faith no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity he did consent he had not been at donwell for two years some very fine morning he and emma and harriet could go very well and he could sit still with mrs weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens he did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of the day he should like to see the old house again exceedingly and should be very happy to meet mr and mrs elton and any other of his neighbours he could not see any objection at all to his and emma s and harriet s going there some very fine morning he thought it very well done of mr knightley to invite them very kind and sensible much cleverer than dining out he was not fond of dining out mr knightley was fortunate in every body s most ready concurrence the invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if like mrs elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it and mr weston unasked promised to get frank over to join them if possible a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with mr knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him and mr weston engaged to lose no time in writing and spare no arguments to induce him to come in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration and at last donwell was settled for one day and box hill for the next the weather appearing exactly right under a bright mid day sun at almost midsummer mr woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of this al fresco party and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise every body to come and sit down and not to heat themselves mrs weston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired and sit all the time with him remained when all the others were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she was satisfied of her father s comfort she was glad to leave him and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream of which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sight and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up the house was larger than hartfield and totally unlike it covering a good deal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable and one or two handsome rooms it was just what it ought to be and it looked what it was and emma felt an increasing respect for it as the residence of a family of such true gentility untainted in blood and understanding some faults of temper john knightley had but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably she had given them neither men nor names nor places that could raise a blush these were pleasant feelings and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did and collect round the strawberry beds the whole party were assembled excepting frank churchill who was expected every moment from richmond and mrs elton in all her apparatus of happiness her large bonnet and her basket was very ready to lead the way in gathering accepting or talking strawberries and only strawberries could now be thought or spoken of the best fruit in england every body s favourite always wholesome these the finest beds and finest sorts delightful to gather for one s self the only way of really enjoying them morning decidedly the best time never tired every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce chili preferred white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in london abundance about bristol maple grove cultivation beds when to be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade such for half an hour was the conversation interrupted only once by mrs weston who came out in her solicitude after her son in law to inquire if he were come and she was a little uneasy she had some fears of his horse seats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs elton and jane fairfax were talking of a situation a most desirable situation was in question mrs elton had received notice of it that morning and was in raptures it was not with mrs suckling it was not with mrs bragge but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them it was with a cousin of mrs bragge an acquaintance of mrs suckling a lady known at maple grove delightful charming superior first circles spheres lines ranks every thing and mrs elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately on her side all was warmth energy and triumph and she positively refused to take her friend s negative though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before still mrs elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow s post how jane could bear it at all was astonishing to emma she did look vexed she did speak pointedly and at last with a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removal should not they walk would not mr knightley shew them the gardens all the gardens she wished to see the whole extent the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear it was hot and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed the h of the pleasure grounds it led to nothing nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had been there disputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty the considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curve around it it was a sweet view sweet to the eye and the mind english verdure english culture english comfort seen under a sun bright without being oppressive in this walk emma and mr weston found all the others assembled and towards this view she immediately perceived mr knightley and harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way mr knightley and harriet it was an odd tête à tête but she was glad to see it there had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony now they seemed in pleasant conversation there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom and light column of smoke ascending she joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc and emma received a smile which seemed to say these are my own concerns i have a right to talk on such subjects without being suspected of introducing robert martin she did not suspect him it was too old a story robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet they took a few turns together along the walk the shade was most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day the next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat and they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come mrs weston looked and looked in vain his father would not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare he had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty his aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting over to them mrs churchill s state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence and mrs weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of mrs churchill that he was prevented coming emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion the cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fish ponds perhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting on the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot and growing cool again mr woodhouse who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens where no damps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more and his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need mr knightley had done all in his power for mr woodhouse s entertainment books of engravings drawers of medals cameos corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets had been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning and the kindness had perfectly answered mr woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused mrs weston had been shewing them all to him and now he would shew them all to emma fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw for he was slow constant and methodical before this second looking over was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments free observation of the entrance and ground plot of the house and was hardly there when jane fairfax appeared coming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there was a start at first but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of will you be so kind said she when i am missed as to say that i am gone home i am going this moment my aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absent but i am sure we shall be wanted and i am determined to go directly i have said nothing about it to any body it would only be giving trouble and distress some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk till they all come in i shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am gone certainly if you wish it but you are not going to walk to highbury alone yes what should hurt me i walk fast i shall be at home in twenty minutes but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone let my father s servant go with you let me order the carriage it can be round in five minutes thank you thank you but on no account i would rather walk and for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone i who may so soon have to guard others she spoke with great agitation and emma very feelingly replied that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now i must order the carriage the heat even would be danger you are fatigued already i am she answered i am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh me miss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits mine i confess are exhausted the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary emma had not another word to oppose she saw it all and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend her parting look was grateful and her parting words oh miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone seemed to burst from an overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who loved her best such a home indeed such an aunt said emma as she turned back into the hall again i do pity you and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the more i shall like you jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only accomplished some views of st mark s place venice when frank churchill entered the room emma had not been thinking of him she had forgotten to think of him but she was very glad to see him mrs weston would be at ease the black mare was blameless _they_ were right who had named mrs churchill as the cause he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her a nervous seizure which had lasted some hours and he had quite given up every thought of coming till very late and had he known how hot a ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be he believed he should not have come at all the heat was excessive he had never suffered any thing like it almost wished he had staid at home nothing killed him like heat he could bear any degree of cold etc but heat was intolerable and he sat down at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr woodhouse s fire looking very deplorable you will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again i could very ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up i met _one_ as i came madness in such weather absolute madness emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchill s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour some people were always cross when they were hot such might be his constitution and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance of every thing in the dining room and she humanely pointed out the door no he should not eat he was not hungry it would only make him hotter in two minutes however he relented in his own favour and muttering something about spruce beer walked off emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret i am glad i have done being in love with him i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning harriet s sweet easy temper will not mind it he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came back all the better grown quite cool and with good manners like himself able to draw a chair close to them take an interest in their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he should be so late he was not in his best spirits but seemed trying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense very agreeably they were looking over views in swisserland as soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad said he i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places you will have my sketches some time or other to look at or my tour to read or my poem i shall do something to expose myself that may be but not by sketches in swisserland you will never go to swisserland your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england they may be induced to go too a warm climate may be prescribed for her i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad i assure you i have i feel a strong persuasion this morning that i shall soon be abroad i ought to travel i am tired of doing nothing i want a change i am serious miss woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy i am sick of england and would leave it to morrow if i could you are sick of prosperity and indulgence cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay _i_ sick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged i am thwarted in every thing material i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us no i shall not stir i shall sit by you you are my best cure we are going to box hill to morrow you will join us it is not swisserland but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change you will stay and go with us no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening but you may come again in the cool of to morrow morning no it will not be worth while if i come i shall be cross then pray stay at richmond but if i do i shall be crosser still i can never bear to think of you all there without me these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself chuse your own degree of crossness i shall press you no more the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill others took it very composedly but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfax s disappearance being explained that it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and with a short final arrangement for the next day s scheme they parted frank churchill s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last words to emma were well if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party i will she smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening chapter vii they had a very fine day for box hill and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality were in favour of a pleasant party mr weston directed the whole officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every body was in good time emma and harriet went together miss bates and her niece with the eltons the gentlemen on horseback mrs weston remained with mr woodhouse nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency there was a languor a want of spirits a want of union which could not be got over they separated too much into parties the eltons walked together mr knightley took charge of miss bates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill and mr weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better it seemed at first an accidental division but it never materially varied mr and mrs elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation between the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any cold collation or any cheerful mr weston to remove at first it was downright dulness to emma she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid he said nothing worth hearing looked without seeing admired without intelligence listened without knowing what she said while he was so dull it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable when they all sat down it was better to her taste a great deal better for frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared for and emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively they were laying themselves open to that very phrase and to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady to ireland by another not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected she laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning back her heart she still intended him for her friend how much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come to day if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party i had quite determined to go away again yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries i was a kinder friend than you deserved but you were humble you begged hard to be commanded to come don t say i was cross i was fatigued the heat overcame me it is hotter to day not to my feelings i am perfectly comfortable to day you are comfortable because you are under command your command yes perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant self command you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to day you are got back again and as i cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine it comes to the same thing i can have no self command without a motive you order me whether you speak or not and you can be always with me you are always with me dating from three o clock yesterday my perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before three o clock yesterday that is your date i thought i had seen you first in february your gallantry is really unanswerable but lowering her voice nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people i say nothing of which i am ashamed replied he with lively impudence i saw you first in february let every body on the hill hear me if they can let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other i saw you first in february and then whispering our companions are excessively stupid what shall we do to rouse them any nonsense will serve they _shall_ talk ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of some laughed and answered good humouredly miss bates said a great deal mrs elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse s presiding mr knightley s answer was the most distinct is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of oh no no cried emma laughing as carelessly as she could upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps glancing at mr weston and harriet whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing it is a sort of thing cried mrs elton emphatically which _i_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into though perhaps as the _chaperon_ of the party _i_ never was in any circle exploring parties young ladies married women her mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured in reply very true my love very true exactly so indeed quite unheard of but some ladies say any thing better pass it off as a joke every body knows what is due to _you_ it will not do whispered frank to emma they are most of them affronted i will attack them with more address ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeated or two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all oh very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy three things very dull indeed that will just do for me you know i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth shan t i looking round with the most good humoured dependence on every body s assent do not you all think i shall emma could not resist ah ma am but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once miss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not immediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could not anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her ah well to be sure yes i see what she means turning to mr knightley and i will try to hold my tongue i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend i like your plan cried mr weston agreed agreed i will do my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon low i am afraid sir very low answered his son but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way no no said emma it will not reckon low a conundrum of mr weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour come sir pray let me hear it i doubt its being very clever myself said mr weston it is too much a matter of fact but here it is what two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection what two letters express perfection i am sure i do not know ah you will never guess you to emma i am certain will never guess i will tell you m and a em ma do you understand understanding and gratification came together it might be a very indifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it and so did frank and harriet it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid about it and mr knightley gravely said this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else _perfection_ should not have come quite so soon oh for myself i protest i must be excused said mrs elton _i_ really cannot attempt i am not at all fond of the sort of thing i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all pleased with i knew who it came from an abominable puppy you know who i mean nodding to her husband these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer miss woodhouse must excuse me i am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service i do not pretend to be a wit i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue pass us if you please mr churchill pass mr e knightley jane and myself we have nothing clever to say not one of us yes yes pray pass _me_ added her husband with a sort of sneering consciousness _i_ have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta with all my heart i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot come jane take my other arm jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off happy couple said frank churchill as soon as they were out of hearing how well they suit one another very lucky marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place they only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath peculiarly lucky for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that bath or any public place can give it is all nothing there can be no knowledge it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment short of that it is all guess and luck and will generally be ill luck how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now such things do occur undoubtedly she was stopped by a cough frank churchill turned towards her to listen you were speaking said he gravely she recovered her voice i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever he made no answer merely looked and bowed in submission and soon afterwards said in a lively tone well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me will you turning to emma will you chuse a wife for me i am sure i should like any body fixed on by you you provide for the family you know with a smile at his father find some body for me i am in no hurry adopt her educate her and make her like myself by all means if you can very well i undertake the commission you shall have a charming wife she must be very lively and have hazle eyes i care for nothing else i shall go abroad for a couple of years and when i return i shall come to you for my wife remember emma was in no danger of forgetting it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling would not harriet be the very creature described hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment who could say referring the education to her seemed to imply it now ma am said jane to her aunt shall we join mrs elton if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well we shall soon overtake her there she is no that s somebody else that s one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her well i declare they walked off followed in half a minute by mr knightley mr weston his son emma and harriet only remained and the young man s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart and the solicitude of mrs elton to have _her_ carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure such another scheme composed of so many ill assorted people she hoped never to be betrayed into again while waiting for the carriage she found mr knightley by her side he looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation emma i had not thought it possible emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off nay how could i help saying what i did nobody could have helped it it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome oh cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her they are blended said he i acknowledge and were she prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner were she your equal in situation but emma consider how far this is from being the case she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more her situation should secure your compassion it was badly done indeed you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly _some_ would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her this is not pleasant to you emma and it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i will i will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless they were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern she had not been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcome then reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference but it was just too late he had turned away and the horses were in motion she continued to look back but in vain and soon with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and every thing left far behind she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed almost beyond what she could conceal never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life she was most forcibly struck the truth of this representation there was no denying she felt it at her heart how could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness time did not compose her as she reflected more she seemed but to feel it more she never had been so depressed happily it was not necessary to speak there was only harriet who seemed not in spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were chapter viii the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma s thoughts all the evening how it might be considered by the rest of the party she could not tell they in their different homes and their different ways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than any she had ever passed a whole evening of back gammon with her father was felicity to it _there_ indeed lay real pleasure for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty four to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach as a daughter she hoped she was not without a heart she hoped no one could have said to her how could you be so unfeeling to your father i must i will tell you truths while i can miss bates should never again no never if attention in future could do away the past she might hope to be forgiven she had been often remiss her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious but it should be so no more in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should be the beginning on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her it was not unlikely she thought that she might see mr knightley in her way or perhaps he might come in while she were paying her visit she had no objection she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she saw him not the ladies were all at home she had never rejoiced at the sound before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule there was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking she heard miss bates s voice something was to be done in a hurry the maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room jane she had a distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door had shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dear i shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are ill enough poor old mrs bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on i am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know they _tell_ me she is well i dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhouse i hope you find a chair i wish hetty had not gone i am very little able have you a chair ma am do you sit where you like i am sure she will be here presently emma seriously hoped she would she had a moment s fear of miss bates keeping away from her but miss bates soon came very happy and obliged but emma s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before less ease of look and manner a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead the way to a return of old feelings the touch seemed immediate ah miss woodhouse how kind you are i suppose you have heard and are come to give us joy this does not seem much like joy indeed in me twinkling away a tear or two but it will be very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long and she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morning such long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell and mrs dixon my dear said i you will blind yourself for tears were in her eyes perpetually one cannot wonder one cannot wonder it is a great change and though she is amazingly fortunate such a situation i suppose as no young woman before ever met with on first going out do not think us ungrateful miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortune again dispersing her tears but poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache she has when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve she is as low as possible to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation you will excuse her not coming to you she is not able she is gone into her own room i want her to lie down upon the bed my dear said i i shall say you are laid down upon the bed but however she is not she is walking about the room but now that she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will excuse her you were kept waiting at the door i was quite ashamed but somehow there was a little bustle for it so happened that we had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did not know any body was coming it is only mrs cole said i depend upon it nobody else would come so early well said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now but then patty came in and said it was you oh said i it is miss woodhouse i am sure you will like to see her i can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away and that was what made us keep you waiting and extremely sorry and ashamed we were if you must go my dear said i you must and i will say you are laid down upon the bed emma was most sincerely interested her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs cole or any other steady friend when she might not bear to see herself she spoke as she felt with earnest regret and solicitude sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on might be as much for miss fairfax s advantage and comfort as possible it must be a severe trial to them all she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell s return so very kind replied miss bates but you are always kind there was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of where may i ask is miss fairfax going to a mrs smallridge charming woman most superior to have the charge of her three little girls delightful children impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps mrs suckling s own family and mrs bragge s but mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood lives only four miles from maple grove jane will be only four miles from maple grove mrs elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes yes our good mrs elton the most indefatigable true friend she would not take a denial she would not let jane say no for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell s return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present and so she told mrs elton over and over again and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind but that good mrs elton whose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take jane s answer but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her she would wait and sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go quite a surprize to me i had not the least idea jane took mrs elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridge s situation she had come to the resolution of accepting it i did not know a word of it till it was all settled you spent the evening with mrs elton yes all of us mrs elton would have us come it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley you _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us said she i positively must have you _all_ come mr knightley was there too was he no not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i thought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let him off he did not but my mother and jane and i were all there and a very agreeable evening we had such kind friends you know miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning s party even pleasure you know is fatiguing and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it however _i_ shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole day i dare say she had whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible i mean as to the character and manners of the family thank you dear miss woodhouse yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it except the sucklings and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs elton s acquaintance mrs smallridge a most delightful woman a style of living almost equal to maple grove and as to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere jane will be treated with such regard and kindness it will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasure and her salary i really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane ah madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned you are so noble in your ideas and when is miss fairfax to leave you very soon very soon indeed that s the worst of it within a fortnight mrs smallridge is in a great hurry my poor mother does not know how to bear it so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and say come ma am do not let us think about it any more her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdy s son wanted to speak with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all and poor john s son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr frank churchill s going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence what mr elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the accumulation of the ostler s own knowledge and the knowledge of the servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill which messenger however had been no more than was expected and that mr churchill had sent his nephew a few lines containing upon the whole a tolerable account of mrs churchill and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early but that mr frank churchill having resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and his horse seeming to have got a cold tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy going a good pace and driving very steady there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it caught emma s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind the contrast between mrs churchill s importance in the world and jane fairfax s struck her one was every thing the other nothing and she sat musing on the difference of woman s destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by miss bates s saying aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become of that very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now you must go said she you and i must part you will have no business here let it stay however said she give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back i shall talk about it to him he will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficulties and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave chapter ix emma s pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her mr knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting with her father mr knightley immediately got up and in a manner decidedly graver than usual said i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly i am going to london to spend a few days with john and isabella have you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time emma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself time however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends again while he stood as if meaning to go but not going her father began his inquiries well my dear and did you get there safely and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before she is always so attentive to them emma s colour was heightened by this unjust praise and with a smile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr knightley it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour as if his eyes received the truth from hers and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured he looked at her with a glow of regard she was warmly gratified and in another moment still more so by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part he took her hand whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say she might perhaps have rather offered it but he took her hand pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips when from some fancy or other he suddenly let it go why he should feel such a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not perceive he would have judged better she thought if he had not stopped the intention however was indubitable and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more it was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction it spoke such perfect amity he left them immediately afterwards gone in a moment he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier it would have been a great pleasure to talk over jane fairfax s situation with mr knightley neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed but it might have happened at a better time and to have had longer notice of it would have been pleasanter they parted thorough friends however she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unhed gallantry it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion he had been sitting with them half an hour she found it was a pity that she had not come back earlier in the hope of diverting her father s thoughts from the disagreeableness of mr knightley s going to london and going so suddenly and going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad emma communicated her news of jane fairfax and her dependence on the effect was justified it supplied a very useful check interested without disturbing him he had long made up his mind to jane fairfax s going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully but mr knightley s going to london had been an unexpected blow i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled mrs elton is very good natured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of it ought to be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylor s always was with me you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs churchill though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account she had not lived above six and thirty hours after his return a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state had carried her off after a short struggle the great mrs churchill was no more it was felt as such things must be felt every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried goldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do but to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill fame mrs churchill after being disliked at least twenty five years was now spoken of with compassionate allowances in one point she was fully justified she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints poor mrs churchill no doubt she had been suffering a great deal more than any body had ever supposed and continual pain would try the temper it was a sad event a great shock with all her faults what would mr churchill do without her mr churchill s loss would be dreadful indeed mr churchill would never get over it even mr weston shook his head and looked solemn and said ah poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his mourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense true and steady how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both it was also a very early speculation with emma the character of mrs churchill the grief of her husband her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event how benefited how freed she saw in a moment all the possible good now an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter mr churchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great self command what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing emma was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance they spoke therefore of mrs churchill s death with mutual forbearance short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans mr churchill was better than could be expected and their first removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor to whom mr churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years at present there was nothing to be done for harriet good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma s side it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax whose prospects were closing while harriet s opened and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished to shew her kindness and with emma it was grown into a first wish she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness and the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew a value for her society and testify respect and consideration she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield a note was written to urge it the invitation was refused and by a verbal message miss fairfax was not well enough to write and when mr perry called at hartfield the same morning it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited though against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering under severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs smallridge s at the time proposed her health seemed for the moment completely deranged appetite quite gone and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension of the family mr perry was uneasy about her he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would not own it her spirits seemed overcome her present home he could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous disorder confined always to one room he could have wished it otherwise and her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description her care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact only too great he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them emma listened with the warmest concern grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful to take her be it only an hour or two from her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two might do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name mentioning that she had mr perry s decided opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient the answer was only in this short note miss fairfax s compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any exercise emma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it was impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted in spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove to mrs bates s in the hope that jane would be induced to join her but it would not do miss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service and every thing that message could do was tried but all in vain miss bates was obliged to return without success jane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse emma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body any body at all mrs elton indeed could not be denied and mrs cole had made such a point and mrs perry had said so much but except them jane would really see nobody emma did not want to be classed with the mrs eltons the mrs perrys and the mrs coles who would force themselves anywhere neither could she feel any right of preference herself she submitted therefore and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece s appetite and diet which she longed to be able to assist on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy and very communicative jane would hardly eat any thing mr perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an examination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note in half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks from miss bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back it was a thing she could not take and moreover she insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon of the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage she could have no doubt putting every thing together that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_ she was sorry very sorry her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself that could mr knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart he would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove chapter x one morning about ten days after mrs churchill s decease emma was called downstairs to mr weston who could not stay five minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her he met her at the parlour door and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father can you come to randalls at any time this morning do if it be possible mrs weston wants to see you she must see you is she unwell no no not at all only a little agitated she would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you _alone_ and that you know nodding towards her father humph can you come certainly this moment if you please it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way but what can be the matter is she really not ill depend upon me but ask no more questions you will know it all in time the most unaccountable business but hush hush to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma something really important seemed announced by his looks but as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father that she would take her walk now she and mr weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls now said emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates now mr weston do let me know what has happened no no he gravely replied don t ask me i promised my wife to leave it all to her she will break it to you better than i can do not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon break it to me cried emma standing still with terror good god mr weston tell me at once something has happened in brunswick square i know it has tell me i charge you tell me this moment what it is no indeed you are mistaken mr weston do not trifle with me consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square which of them is it i charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment upon my word emma your word why not your honour why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them good heavens what can be to be _broke_ to me that does not relate to one of that family upon my honour said he very seriously it does not it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley emma s courage returned and she walked on i was wrong he continued in talking of its being _broke_ to you i should not have used the expression in fact it does not concern you it concerns only myself that is we hope humph in short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it i don t say that it is not a disagreeable business but things might be much worse if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern something just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family something which the late event at richmond had brought forward her fancy was very active half a dozen natural children perhaps and poor frank cut off this though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her it inspired little more than an animating curiosity who is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded speaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with any other view i do not know one of the otways not frank it is not frank i assure you you will not see him he is half way to windsor by this time has your son been with you then oh yes did not you know well well never mind for a moment he was silent and then added in a tone much more guarded and demure yes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did they hurried on and were speedily at randalls well my dear said he as they entered the room i have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better i shall leave you together there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me and emma distinctly heard him add in a lower tone before he quitted the room i have been as good as my word she has not the least idea mrs weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation that emma s uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone she eagerly said what is it my dear friend something of a very unpleasant nature i find has occurred do let me know directly what it is i have been walking all this way in complete suspense we both abhor suspense do not let mine continue longer it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be have you indeed no idea said mrs weston in a trembling voice cannot you my dear emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear so far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess you are right it does relate to him and i will tell you directly resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up he has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand it is impossible to express our surprize he came to speak to his father on a subject to announce an attachment she stopped to breathe emma thought first of herself and then of harriet more than an attachment indeed resumed mrs weston an engagement a positive engagement what will you say emma what will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged nay that they have been long engaged emma even jumped with surprize and horror struck exclaimed jane fairfax good god you are not serious you do not mean it you may well be amazed returned mrs weston still averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover you may well be amazed but it is even so there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october formed at weymouth and kept a secret from every body not a creature knowing it but themselves neither the campbells nor her family nor his it is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself i can hardly believe it i thought i knew him emma scarcely heard what was said her mind was divided between two ideas her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax and poor harriet and for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation repeated confirmation well said she at last trying to recover herself this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at all comprehend it what engaged to her all the winter before either of them came to highbury engaged since october secretly engaged it has hurt me emma very much it has hurt his father equally _some_ _part_ of his conduct we cannot excuse emma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend _not_ to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of mrs weston looked up afraid to believe but emma s countenance was as steady as her words that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to him nay was attached and how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder fortunately however it did cease i have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him you may believe me mrs weston this is the simple truth mrs weston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could find utterance assured her that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do mr weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she on this point we have been wretched it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other and we were persuaded that it was so imagine what we have been feeling on your account i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself but this does not acquit _him_ mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so _very_ disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did while he really belonged to another how could he tell what mischief he might be doing how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him very wrong very wrong indeed from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine and how could _she_ bear such behaviour composure with a witness to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent it that is a degree of placidity which i can neither comprehend nor respect there were misunderstandings between them emma he said so expressly he had not time to enter into much explanation he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct impropriety oh mrs weston it is too calm a censure much much beyond impropriety it has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion so unlike what a man should be none of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life nay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and good god cried emma not attending to her mrs smallridge too jane actually on the point of going as governess what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer her to engage herself to suffer her even to think of such a measure he knew nothing about it emma on this article i can fully acquit him it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to him or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction till yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long emma began to listen better i am to hear from him soon continued mrs weston he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now let us wait therefore for this letter it may bring many extenuations it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood don t let us be severe don t let us be in a hurry to condemn him let us have patience i must love him and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment _his_ sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done him much harm well and how did mr churchill take it most favourably for his nephew gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty conceive what the events of a week have done in that family while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a hope a chance a possibility but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required what a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave he gave his consent with very little persuasion ah thought emma he would have done as much for harriet this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this morning he stopped at highbury at the bates s i fancy some time and then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour he was very much agitated very much indeed to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before in addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy the campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush none not one he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves well said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and i wish them very happy but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit espionage and treachery to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us all here have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear they must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable i am quite easy on that head replied mrs weston i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard you are in luck your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady true but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe at this moment mr weston appeared at a little distance from the window evidently on the watch his wife gave him a look which invited him in and while he was coming round added now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error much indeed cried emma feelingly if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfax s of such one may almost say that the world is not their s nor the world s law she met mr weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance exclaiming a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing but you really frightened me i thought you had lost half your property at least and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation i congratulate you mr weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter a glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate his air and voice recovered their usual briskness he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence or smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all over together and he had talked it all over again with emma in their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly reconciled and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done chapter xi harriet poor harriet those were the words in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted the real misery of the business to her frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself very ill in many ways but it was not so much _his_ behaviour as her _own_ which made her so angry with him it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet s account that gave the deepest hue to his offence poor harriet to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery mr knightley had spoken prophetically when he once said emma you have been no friend to harriet smith she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice it was true that she had not to charge herself in this instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet s imagination for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments her influence would have been enough and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them she felt that she had been risking her friend s happiness on most insufficient grounds common sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her but with common sense she added i am afraid i have had little to do she was extremely angry with herself if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful as for jane fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account harriet would be anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about jane whose troubles and whose ill health having of course the same origin must be equally under cure her days of insignificance and evil were over she would soon be well and happy and prosperous emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted this discovery laid many smaller matters open no doubt it had been from jealousy in jane s eyes she had been a rival and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison she understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first considering the very superior claims of the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriet s mind producing reserve and self command it would she must communicate the painful truth however and as soon as possible an injunction of secresy had been among mr weston s parting words for the present the whole affair was to be completely a secret mr churchill had made a point of it as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum emma had promised but still harriet must be excepted it was her superior duty in spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet which mrs weston had just gone through by herself the intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her she was now to be anxiously announcing to another her heart beat quick on hearing harriet s footstep and voice so she supposed had poor mrs weston felt when _she_ was approaching randalls could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance but of that unfortunately there could be no chance well miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into the room is not this the oddest news that ever was what news do you mean replied emma unable to guess by look or voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint about jane fairfax did you ever hear any thing so strange oh you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it what did mr weston tell you said emma still perplexed oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while how very odd it was indeed so odd harriet s behaviour was so extremely odd that emma did not know how to understand it her character appeared absolutely changed she seemed to propose shewing no agitation or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery emma looked at her quite unable to speak had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love with her you perhaps might you blushing as she spoke who can see into every body s heart but nobody else upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was tacitly if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelings i never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax you may be very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly me cried harriet colouring and astonished why should you caution me you do not think i care about mr frank churchill i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him him never never dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me turning away distressed harriet cried emma after a moment s pause what do you mean good heaven what do you mean mistake you am i to suppose then she could not speak another word her voice was lost and she sat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma s i should not have thought it possible she began that you could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person mr frank churchill indeed i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who is like nobody by his side and that you should have been so mistaken is amazing i am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words i should not have dared to give way to i should not have thought it possible but if _you_ who had been always acquainted with him harriet cried emma collecting herself resolutely let us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake are you speaking of mr knightley to be sure i am i never could have an idea of any body else and so i thought you knew when we talked about him it was as clear as possible not quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person i could almost assert that you had _named_ mr frank churchill i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of oh miss woodhouse how you do forget my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue the impression of it is strong on my memory oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time it was not the gipsies it was not mr frank churchill that i meant no with some elevation i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance of mr knightley s coming and asking me to dance when mr elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth good god cried emma this has been a most unfortunate most deplorable mistake what is to be done you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and now it _is_ possible she paused a few moments emma could not speak i do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other but i hope miss woodhouse that supposing that if strange as it may appear but you know they were your own words that _more_ wonderful things had happened matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to if mr knightley should really if _he_ does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way but you are too good for that i am sure harriet was standing at one of the windows emma turned round to look at her in consternation and hastily said have you any idea of mr knightley s returning your affection yes replied harriet modestly but not fearfully i must say that i have emma s eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating in a fixed attitude for a few minutes a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart a mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress she touched she admitted she acknowledged the whole truth why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr knightley than with frank churchill why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriet s having some hope of a return it darted through her with the speed of an arrow that mr knightley must marry no one but herself her own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the same few minutes she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before how improperly had she been acting by harriet how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been her conduct what blindness what madness had led her on it struck her with dreadful force and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits some concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice by harriet there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by mr knightley but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindness for her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost extent of harriet s hopes should be enquired into and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained or to deserve to be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right rousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion she turned to harriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed the conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it the wonderful story of jane fairfax that was quite sunk and lost neither of them thought but of mr knightley and themselves harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge and such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation to give the history of her hopes with great though trembling delight emma s tremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than harriet s but they were not less her voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create she listened with much inward suffering but with great outward patience to harriet s detail methodical or well arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration a substance to sink her spirit especially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of mr knightley s most improved opinion of harriet harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances emma knew that he had on that occasion found her much superior to his expectation from that evening or at least from the time of miss woodhouse s encouraging her to think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness and sweetness latterly she had been more and more aware of it when they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very delightfully he seemed to want to be acquainted with her emma knew it to have been very much the case she had often observed the change to almost the same extent harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet he praised her for being without art or affectation for having simple honest generous feelings she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet he had dwelt on them to her more than once much that lived in harriet s memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected by emma circumstances that might swell to half an hour s relation and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not without some degree of witness from emma herself the first was his walking with her apart from the others in the lime walk at donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himself and at first he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before in a very particular way indeed harriet could not recall it without a blush he seemed to be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged but as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about farming the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at hartfield though when he first came in he had said that he could not stay five minutes and his having told her during their conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to _her_ the superior degree of confidence towards harriet which this one article marked gave her severe pain on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did after a little reflection venture the following question might he not is not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martin he might have mr martin s interest in view but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it when harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope i never should have presumed to think of it at first said she but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emma s side to enable her to say on reply harriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her father s footsteps he was coming through the hall harriet was too much agitated to encounter him she could not compose herself mr woodhouse would be alarmed she had better go with most ready encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another door and the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of emma s feelings oh god that i had never seen her the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her thoughts she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours every moment had brought a fresh surprize and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her how to understand it all how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself and living under the blunders the blindness of her own head and heart she sat still she walked about she tried her own room she tried the shrubbery in every place every posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying that she was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour to that point went every leisure moment which her father s claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind how long had mr knightley been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be when had his influence such influence begun when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank churchill had once for a short period occupied she looked back she compared the two compared them as they had always stood in her estimation from the time of the latter s becoming known to her and as they must at any time have been compared by her had it oh had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear she saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own heart and in short that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection this was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which she reached and without being long in reaching it she was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her her affection for mr knightley every other part of her mind was disgusting with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body s feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body s destiny she was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothing for she had done mischief she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared on mr knightley were this most unequal of all connexions to take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harriet s and even were this not the case he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly mr knightley and harriet smith it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace threadbare stale in the comparison exciting no surprize presenting no disparity affording nothing to be said or thought mr knightley and harriet smith such an elevation on her side such a debasement on his it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion to foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt at his expense the mortification and disdain of his brother the thousand inconveniences to himself could it be no it was impossible and yet it was far very far from impossible was it a new circumstance for a man of first rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers was it new for one perhaps too busy to seek to be the prize of a girl who would seek him was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent incongruous or for chance and circumstance as second causes to direct the human fate oh had she never brought harriet forward had she left her where she ought and where he had told her she ought had she not with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong all would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr knightley how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it but harriet was less humble had fewer scruples than formerly her inferiority whether of mind or situation seemed little felt she had seemed more sensible of mr elton s being to stoop in marrying her than she now seemed of mr knightley s alas was not that her own doing too who had been at pains to give harriet notions of self consequence but herself who but herself had taught her that she was to elevate herself if possible and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment if harriet from being humble were grown vain it was her doing too chapter xii till now that she was threatened with its loss emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with mr knightley first in interest and affection satisfied that it was so and feeling it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection and only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important it had been long very long she felt she had been first for having no female connexions of his own there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella she had herself been first with him for many years past she had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own but still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared in spite of all her faults she knew she was dear to him might she not say very dear when the suggestions of hope however which must follow here presented themselves she could not presume to indulge them harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly exclusively passionately loved by mr knightley _she_ could not she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_ she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates how directly how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject not too strongly for the offence but far far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear sighted goodwill she had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question but there was a hope at times a slight one at times much stronger that harriet might have deceived herself and be overrating his regard for _her_ wish it she must for his sake be the consequence nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life could she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all she believed she should be perfectly satisfied let him but continue the same mr knightley to her and her father the same mr knightley to all the world let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence and her peace would be fully secured marriage in fact would not do for her it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father and with what she felt for him nothing should separate her from her father she would not marry even if she were asked by mr knightley it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed and she hoped that when able to see them together again she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were she should see them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here he was expected back every day the power of observation would be soon given frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course in the meanwhile she resolved against seeing harriet it would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good to be talking of it farther she was resolved not to be convinced as long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing harriet s confidence to talk would be only to irritate she wrote to her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not at present come to hartfield acknowledging it to be her conviction that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again except in the company of others she objected only to a tête à tête they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday harriet submitted and approved and was grateful this point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear emma s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twenty four hours mrs weston who had been calling on her daughter in law elect and took hartfield in her way home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview mr weston had accompanied her to mrs bates s and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs bates s parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded a little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while her friend related mrs weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed and mr churchill could be reconciled to the engagement s becoming known as considering every thing she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports but mr weston had thought differently he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were that it would be of any consequence for such things he observed always got about emma smiled and felt that mr weston had very good reason for saying so they had gone in short and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady she had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness the quiet heart felt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her daughter who proved even too joyous to talk as usual had been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene they were both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation thought so much of jane so much of every body and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them miss fairfax s recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs weston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and declined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the course of their drive mrs weston had by gentle encouragement overcome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse on the important subject apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr weston must necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement mrs weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so many months continued mrs weston she was energetic this was one of her expressions i will not say that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments but i can say that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour and the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation that i felt at my heart poor girl said emma she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement wrong no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself the consequence said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct pain is no expiation i never can be blameless i have been acting contrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken and the kindness i am now receiving is what my conscience tells me ought not to be do not imagine madam she continued that i was taught wrong do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up the error has been all my own and i do assure you that with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell poor girl said emma again she loves him then excessively i suppose it must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement her affection must have overpowered her judgment yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him i am afraid returned emma sighing that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy on your side my love it was very innocently done but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was that of making her _unreasonable_ the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had been hard for him to bear i did not make the allowances said she which i ought to have done for his temper and spirits his delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank you i could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself if i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not bear these thanks for oh mrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax well checking herself and trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars they shew her to the greatest advantage i am sure she is very good i hope she will be very happy it is fit that the fortune should be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs weston she thought well of frank in almost every respect and what was more she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest she talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection but she had too much to urge for emma s attention it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when mrs weston ended with we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for are you well my emma was mrs weston s parting question oh perfectly i am always well you know be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible mrs weston s communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause had she followed mr knightley s known wishes in paying that attention to miss fairfax which was every way her due had she tried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith she must in all probability have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now birth abilities and education had been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received with gratitude and the other what was she supposing even that they had never become intimate friends that she had never been admitted into miss fairfax s confidence on this important matter which was most probable still in knowing her as she ought and as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr dixon which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so unpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane s feelings by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill s of all the sources of evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst she must have been a perpetual enemy they never could have been all three together without her having stabbed jane fairfax s peace in a thousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield the weather added what it could of gloom a cold stormy rain set in and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights the longer visible the weather affected mr woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter s side and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before it reminded her of their first forlorn tête à tête on the evening of mrs weston s wedding day but mr knightley had walked in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy alas such delightful proofs of hartfield s attraction as those sort of visits conveyed might shortly be over the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lost but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction the prospect before her now was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled that might not be even partially brightened if all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must be comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself and mrs weston s heart and time would be occupied by it they should lose her and probably in great measure her husband also frank churchill would return among them no more and miss fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease to belong to highbury they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe all that were good would be withdrawn and if to these losses the loss of donwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach mr knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort no longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change his own home for their s how was it to be endured and if he were to be lost to them for harriet s sake if he were to be thought of hereafter as finding in harriet s society all that he wanted if harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence what could be increasing emma s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her own work when it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a few seconds and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone chapter xiii the weather continued much the same all the following morning and the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to reign at hartfield but in the afternoon it cleared the wind changed into a softer quarter the clouds were carried off the sun appeared it was summer again with all the eagerness which such a transition gives emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible never had the exquisite sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm been more attractive to her she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce and on mr perry s coming in soon after dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery there with spirits freshened and thoughts a little relieved she had taken a few turns when she saw mr knightley passing through the garden door and coming towards her it was the first intimation of his being returned from london she had been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles distant there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind she must be collected and calm in half a minute they were together the how d ye do s were quiet and constrained on each side she asked after their mutual friends they were all well when had he left them only that morning he must have had a wet ride yes he meant to walk with her she found he had just looked into the dining room and as he was not wanted there preferred being out of doors she thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible cause for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner in which they had been received they walked together he was silent she thought he was often looking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give and this belief produced another dread perhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to harriet he might be watching for encouragement to begin she did not could not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject he must do it all himself yet she could not bear this silence with him it was most unnatural she considered resolved and trying to smile began you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you have i said he quietly and looking at her of what nature oh the best nature in the world a wedding after waiting a moment as if to be sure she intended to say no more he replied if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already how is it possible cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards him for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs goddard s in his way i had a few lines on parish business from mr weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened emma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little more composure _you_ probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution i wish i had attended to it but with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh i seem to have been doomed to blindness for a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low time my dearest emma time will heal the wound your own excellent sense your exertions for your father s sake i know you will not allow yourself her arm was pressed again as he added in a more broken and subdued accent the feelings of the warmest friendship indignation abominable scoundrel and in a louder steadier tone he concluded with he will soon be gone they will soon be in yorkshire i am sorry for _her_ she deserves a better fate emma understood him and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied you are very kind but you are mistaken and i must set you right i am not in want of that sort of compassion my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier emma cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed but checking himself no no i understand you forgive me i am pleased that you can say even so much he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled i could never i confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt i could only be certain that there was a preference and a preference which i never believed him to deserve he is a disgrace to the name of man and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman jane jane you will be a miserable creature mr knightley said emma trying to be lively but really confused i am in a very extraordinary situation i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse but i never have he listened in perfect silence she wished him to speak but he would not she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion she went on however i have very little to say for my own conduct i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased an old story probably a common case and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding many circumstances assisted the temptation he was the son of mr weston he was continually here i always found him very pleasant and in short for with a sigh let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions latterly however for some time indeed i have had no idea of their meaning any thing i thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side he has imposed on me but he has not injured me i have never been attached to him and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour he never wished to attach me it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself except that i was _not_ blinded that it was my good fortune that in short i was somehow or other safe from him she had hoped for an answer here for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible but he was silent and as far as she could judge deep in thought at last and tolerably in his usual tone he said i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill i can suppose however that i may have underrated him my acquaintance with him has been but trifling and even if i have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well with such a woman he has a chance i have no motive for wishing him ill and for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him well i have no doubt of their being happy together said emma i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached he is a most fortunate man returned mr knightley with energy so early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three and twenty to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for jane fairfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation i mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of _her_ regard must i think be the happiest of mortals frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune every thing turns out for his good he meets with a young woman at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior his aunt is in the way his aunt dies he has only to speak his friends are eager to promote his happiness he had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him he is a fortunate man indeed you speak as if you envied him and i do envy him emma in one respect he is the object of my envy emma could say no more they seemed to be within half a sentence of harriet and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject if possible she made her plan she would speak of something totally different the children in brunswick square and she only waited for breath to begin when mr knightley startled her by saying you will not ask me what is the point of envy you are determined i see to have no curiosity you are wise but _i_ cannot be wise emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment oh then don t speak it don t speak it she eagerly cried take a little time consider do not commit yourself thank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not another syllable followed emma could not bear to give him pain he was wishing to confide in her perhaps to consult her cost her what it would she would listen she might assist his resolution or reconcile him to it she might give just praise to harriet or by representing to him his own independence relieve him from that state of indecision which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his they had reached the house you are going in i suppose said he no replied emma quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke i should like to take another turn mr perry is not gone and after proceeding a few steps she added i stopped you ungraciously just now mr knightley and i am afraid gave you pain but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation as a friend indeed you may command me i will hear whatever you like i will tell you exactly what i think as a friend repeated mr knightley emma that i fear is a word no i have no wish stay yes why should i hesitate i have gone too far already for concealment emma i accept your offer extraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you as a friend tell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding he stopped in his earnestness to look the question and the expression of his eyes overpowered her my dearest emma said he for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hour s conversation my dearest most beloved emma tell me at once say no if it is to be said she could really say nothing you are silent he cried with great animation absolutely silent at present i ask no more emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream was perhaps the most prominent feeling i cannot make speeches emma he soon resumed and in a tone of such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing if i loved you less i might be able to talk about it more but you know what i am you hear nothing but truth from me i have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them god knows i have been a very indifferent lover but you understand me yes you see you understand my feelings and will return them if you can at present i ask only to hear once to hear your voice while he spoke emma s mind was most busy and with all the wonderful velocity of thought had been able and yet without losing a word to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole to see that harriet s hopes had been entirely groundless a mistake a delusion as complete a delusion as any of her own that harriet was nothing that she was every thing herself that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance her discouragement had been all received as discouragement from herself and not only was there time for these convictions with all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to rejoice that harriet s secret had not escaped her and to resolve that it need not and should not it was all the service she could now render her poor friend for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the two or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever without vouchsafing any motive because he could not marry them both emma had it not she felt for harriet with pain and with contrition but no flight of generosity run mad opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain she had led her friend astray and it would be a reproach to her for ever but her judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever been before in reprobating any such alliance for him as most unequal and degrading her way was clear though not quite smooth she spoke then on being so entreated what did she say just what she ought of course a lady always does she said enough to shew there need not be despair and to invite him to say more himself he _had_ despaired at one period he had received such an injunction to caution and silence as for the time crushed every hope she had begun by refusing to hear him the change had perhaps been somewhat sudden her proposal of taking another turn her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to might be a little extraordinary she felt its inconsistency but mr knightley was so obliging as to put up with it and seek no farther explanation seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material mr knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his he had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it he had come in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill s engagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel her the rest had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill of her having a heart completely disengaged from him had given birth to the hope that in time he might gain her affection himself but it had been no present hope he had only in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her the superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting the affection which he had been asking to be allowed to create if he could was already his within half an hour he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind to something so like perfect happiness that it could bear no other name _her_ change was equal this one half hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust on his side there had been a long standing jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of frank churchill he had been in love with emma and jealous of frank churchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the country the box hill party had decided him on going away he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted encouraged attentions he had gone to learn to be indifferent but he had gone to a wrong place there was too much domestic happiness in his brother s house woman wore too amiable a form in it isabella was too much like emma differing only in those striking inferiorities which always brought the other in brilliancy before him for much to have been done even had his time been longer he had stayed on however vigorously day after day till this very morning s post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax then with the gladness which must be felt nay which he did not scruple to feel having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma was there so much fond solicitude so much keen anxiety for her that he could stay no longer he had ridden home through the rain and had walked up directly after dinner to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures faultless in spite of all her faults bore the discovery he had found her agitated and low frank churchill was a villain he heard her declare that she had never loved him frank churchill s character was not desperate she was his own emma by hand and word when they returned into the house and if he could have thought of frank churchill then he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow chapter xiv what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought out she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away they sat down to tea the same party round the same table how often it had been collected and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun but never in such a state of spirits never in any thing like it and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house or even the attentive daughter poor mr woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride could he have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr perry and talked on with much self contentment totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return as long as mr knightley remained with them emma s fever continued but when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued and in the course of the sleepless night which was the tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious points to consider as made her feel that even her happiness must have some alloy her father and harriet she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question with respect to her father it was a question soon answered she hardly knew yet what mr knightley would ask but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father she even wept over the idea of it as a sin of thought while he lived it must be only an engagement but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him how to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision how to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make her any possible atonement how to appear least her enemy on these subjects her perplexity and distress were very great and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it she could only resolve at last that she would still avoid a meeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from highbury and indulging in one scheme more nearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to brunswick square isabella had been pleased with harriet and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement she did not think it in harriet s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety by the streets the shops and the children at any rate it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself from whom every thing was due a separation for the present an averting of the evil day when they must all be together again she rose early and wrote her letter to harriet an employment which left her so very serious so nearly sad that mr knightley in walking up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before he had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter was brought her from randalls a very thick letter she guessed what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill she wanted no explanations she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself and as for understanding any thing he wrote she was sure she was incapable of it it must be waded through however she opened the packet it was too surely so a note from mrs weston to herself ushered in the letter from frank to mrs weston i have the greatest pleasure my dear emma in forwarding to you the enclosed i know what thorough justice you will do it and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again but i will not delay you by a long preface we are quite well this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have been feeling lately i did not quite like your looks on tuesday but it was an ungenial morning and though you will never own being affected by weather i think every body feels a north east wind i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning but had the comfort of hearing last night by mr perry that it had not made him ill yours ever a w _to mrs weston_ windsor july my dear madam if i made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be expected but expected or not i know it will be read with candour and indulgence you are all goodness and i believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent my courage rises while i write it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble i have already met with such success in two applications for pardon that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence you must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards this was the fact my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment is another question i shall not discuss it here for my temptation to _think_ it a right i refer every caviller to a brick house sashed windows below and casements above in highbury i dared not address her openly my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to require definition and i was fortunate enough to prevail before we parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement had she refused i should have gone mad but you will be ready to say what was your hope in doing this what did you look forward to to any thing every thing to time chance circumstance slow effects sudden bursts perseverance and weariness health and sickness every possibility of good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence if you need farther explanation i have the honour my dear madam of being your husband s son and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of see me then under these circumstances arriving on my first visit to randalls and here i am conscious of wrong for that visit might have been sooner paid you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax was in highbury and as _you_ were the person slighted you will forgive me instantly but i must work on my father s compassion by reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house so long i lost the blessing of knowing you my behaviour during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you did not i hope lay me open to reprehension excepting on one point and now i come to the principal the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation with the greatest respect and the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse my father perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought in order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible object but i am sure you will believe the declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much my conviction as my wish she received my attentions with an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me we seemed to understand each other from our relative situation those attentions were her due and were felt to be so whether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight i cannot say when i called to take leave of her i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth and i then fancied she was not without suspicion but i have no doubt of her having since detected me at least in some degree she may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must have penetrated a part i cannot doubt it you will find whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints that it did not take her wholly by surprize she frequently gave me hints of it i remember her telling me at the ball that i owed mrs elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse i could deserve nothing from either acquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have now a key to my heart was in highbury and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account of the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to you will soon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself no description can describe her she must tell you herself what she is yet not by word for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit since i began this letter which will be longer than i foresaw i have heard from her she gives a good account of her own health but as she never complains i dare not depend i want to have your opinion of her looks i know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit perhaps it is paid already let me hear from you without delay i am impatient for a thousand particulars remember how few minutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state and i am not much better yet still insane either from happiness or misery when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with of her excellence and patience and my uncle s generosity i am mad with joy but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her and how little i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger if i could but see her again but i must not propose it yet my uncle has been too good for me to encroach i must still add to this long letter you have not heard all that you ought to hear i could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out needs explanation for though the event of the 26th ult as you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects i should not have presumed on such early measures but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement but i had no choice the hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman here my dear madam i was obliged to leave off abruptly to recollect and compose myself i have been walking over the country and am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be it is in fact a most mortifying retrospect for me i behaved shamefully and here i can admit that my manners to miss w in being unpleasant to miss f were highly blameable _she_ disapproved them which ought to have been enough my plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient she was displeased i thought unreasonably so i thought her on a thousand occasions unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious i thought her even cold but she was always right if i had followed her judgment and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known we quarrelled do you remember the morning spent at donwell _there_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis i was late i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she would not suffer it she absolutely refused to allow me which i then thought most unreasonable now however i see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion while i to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless had we been met walking together between donwell and highbury the truth must have been suspected i was mad enough however to resent i doubted her affection i doubted it more the next day on box hill when provoked by such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her and such apparent devotion to miss w as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me in short my dear madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side abominable on mine and i returned the same evening to richmond though i might have staid with you till the next morning merely because i would be as angry with her as possible even then i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time but i was the injured person injured by her coldness and i went away determined that she should make the first advances i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party had you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced as soon as she found i was really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that officious mrs elton the whole system of whose treatment of her by the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself but otherwise i should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known jane indeed you will observe that i have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you think then what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority have patience with me i shall soon have done she closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again _she_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt s death i answered it within an hour but from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in my writing desk and i trusting that i had written enough though but a few lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness i was rather disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily but i made excuses for her and was too busy and may i add too cheerful in my views to be captious we removed to windsor and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters all returned and a few lines at the same time by the post stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last and adding that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible she now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested that if i could not directly command hers so as to send them to highbury within a week i would forward them after that period to her at in short the full direction to mr smallridge s near bristol stared me in the face i knew the name the place i knew all about it and instantly saw what she had been doing it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess and the secrecy she had maintained as to any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy for the world would not she have seemed to threaten me imagine the shock imagine how till i had actually detected my own blunder i raved at the blunders of the post what was to be done one thing only i must speak to my uncle without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again i spoke circumstances were in my favour the late event had softened away his pride and he was earlier than i could have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying and could say at last poor man with a deep sigh that he wished i might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done i felt that it would be of a different sort are you disposed to pity me for what i must have suffered in opening the cause to him for my suspense while all was at stake no do not pity me till i reached highbury and saw how ill i had made her do not pity me till i saw her wan sick looks i reached highbury at the time of day when from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour i was certain of a good chance of finding her alone i was not disappointed and at last i was not disappointed either in the object of my journey a great deal of very reasonable very just displeasure i had to persuade away but it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no moment s uneasiness can ever occur between us again now my dear madam i will release you but i could not conclude before a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her if you think me in a way to be happier than i deserve i am quite of your opinion miss w calls me the child of good fortune i hope she is right in one respect my good fortune is undoubted that of being able to subscribe myself your obliged and affectionate son f c weston churchill chapter xv this letter must make its way to emma s feelings she was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that mrs weston foretold as soon as she came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment she never stopt till she had gone through the whole and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed and he had suffered and was very sorry and he was so grateful to mrs weston and so much in love with miss fairfax and she was so happy herself that there was no being severe and could he have entered the room she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever she thought so well of the letter that when mr knightley came again she desired him to read it she was sure of mrs weston s wishing it to be communicated especially to one who like mr knightley had seen so much to blame in his conduct i shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long i will take it home with me at night but that would not do mr weston was to call in the evening and she must return it by him i would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done he began stopping however almost directly to say had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference he proceeded a little farther reading to himself and then with a smile observed humph a fine complimentary opening but it is his way one man s style must not be the rule of another s we will not be severe it will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my opinion aloud as i read by doing it i shall feel that i am near you it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it not at all i should wish it mr knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity he trifles here said he as to the temptation he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge bad he ought not to have formed the engagement his father s disposition he is unjust however to his father mr weston s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here and i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma but yet i think had _you_ not been in the case i should still have distrusted him when he came to miss woodhouse he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud all that related to her with a smile a look a shake of the head a word or two of assent or disapprobation or merely of love as the subject required concluding however seriously and after steady reflection thus very bad though it might have been worse playing a most dangerous game too much indebted to the event for his acquittal no judge of his own manners by you always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience fancying you to have fathomed his secret natural enough his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others mystery finesse how they pervert the understanding my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on harriet s account which she could not give any sincere explanation of you had better go on said she he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure a boyish scheme indeed i cannot comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could after this he made some progress without any pause frank churchill s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing i perfectly agree with you sir was then his remark you did behave very shamefully you never wrote a truer line and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfax s sense of right he made a fuller pause to say this is very bad he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party and grew uncomfortable her own behaviour had been so very improper she was deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look it was all read however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark and excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear of giving pain no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons was his next observation his feelings are natural what actually resolve to break with him entirely she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour well he must be a most extraordinary nay nay read on you will find how very much he suffers i hope he does replied mr knightley coolly and resuming the letter smallridge what does this mean what is all this she had engaged to go as governess to mrs smallridge s children a dear friend of mrs elton s a neighbour of maple grove and by the bye i wonder how mrs elton bears the disappointment say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read not even of mrs elton only one page more i shall soon have done what a letter the man writes i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him well there _is_ feeling here he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her dearer much dearer than ever i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands happier than i deserve come he knows himself there miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune those were miss woodhouse s words were they and a fine ending and there is the letter the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am but still you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it i hope it does him some service with you yes certainly it does he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants and now let me talk to you of something else i have another person s interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject the subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english such as mr knightley used even to the woman he was in love with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the happiness of her father emma s answer was ready at the first word while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her she could never quit him part only of this answer however was admitted the impossibility of her quitting her father mr knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to he had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce mr woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father s comfort perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded mr woodhouse taken from hartfield no he felt that it ought not to be attempted but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable it was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as her father s happiness in other words his life required hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise of their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own passing thoughts like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her she was sensible of all the affection it evinced she felt that in quitting donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with she promised to think of it and advised him to think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject he had given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning to have his thoughts to himself ah there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma i am sure william larkins will not like it you must get his consent before you ask mine she promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax or any body else which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield the more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became his evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase their mutual good to outweigh every drawback such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy she would have been too happy but for poor harriet but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself poor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a distance from she would be a loser in every way emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment in such a party harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise but for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment in time of course mr knightley would be forgotten that is supplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early mr knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure not like mr elton mr knightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year chapter xvi it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting their intercourse was painful enough by letter how much worse had they been obliged to meet harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent sense of ill usage and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate it might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke she had no difficulty in procuring isabella s invitation and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it without resorting to invention there was a tooth amiss harriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist mrs john knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her and though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr wingfield she was quite eager to have harriet under her care when it was thus settled on her sister s side emma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable harriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was to be conveyed in mr woodhouse s carriage it was all arranged it was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick square now emma could indeed enjoy mr knightley s visits now she could talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her how much might at that moment and at a little distance be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself the difference of harriet at mrs goddard s or in london made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma s sensations but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied there was a communication before her one which _she_ only could be competent to make the confession of her engagement to her father but she would have nothing to do with it at present she had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs weston were safe and well no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time a fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers she soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax she ought to go and she was longing to see her the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill it would be a _secret_ satisfaction but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate she went she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected the fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name she heard patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible no she heard nothing but the instant reply of beg her to walk up and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient emma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging there was consciousness animation and warmth there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted she came forward with an offered hand and said in a low but very feeling tone this is most kind indeed miss woodhouse it is impossible for me to express i hope you will believe excuse me for being so entirely without words emma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words if the sound of mrs elton s voice from the sitting room had not checked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest shake of the hand mrs bates and mrs elton were together miss bates was out which accounted for the previous tranquillity emma could have wished mrs elton elsewhere but she was in a humour to have patience with every body and as mrs elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs elton s thoughts and understand why she was like herself in happy spirits it was being in miss fairfax s confidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face and while paying her own compliments to mrs bates and appearing to attend to the good old lady s replies she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods we can h this some other time you know you and i shall not want opportunities and in fact you have heard all the essential already i only wanted to prove to you that mrs s admits our apology and is not offended you see how delightfully she writes oh she is a sweet creature you would have doated on her had you gone but not a word more let us be discreet quite on our good behaviour hush you remember those lines i forget the poem at this moment for when a lady s in the case you know all other things give place now i say my dear in _our_ case for _lady_ read mum a word to the wise i am in a fine flow of spirits an t i but i want to set your heart at ease as to mrs s _my_ representation you see has quite appeased her and again on emma s merely turning her head to look at mrs bates s knitting she added in a half whisper i mentioned no _names_ you will observe oh no cautious as a minister of state i managed it extremely well emma could not doubt it was a palpable display repeated on every possible occasion when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs weston she found herself abruptly addressed with do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit here was a side glance of great meaning at jane upon my word perry has restored her in a wonderful short time oh if you had seen her as i did when she was at the worst and when mrs bates was saying something to emma whispered farther we do not say a word of any _assistance_ that perry might have not a word of a certain young physician from windsor oh no perry shall have all the credit i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill very pleasant party but yet i think there was something wanting things did not seem that is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some so it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken however i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again what say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lasts it must be the same party you know quite the same party not _one_ exception soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness it is impossible to say yes indeed i quite understand dearest jane s prospects that is i do not mean but she is charmingly recovered how is mr woodhouse i am so glad quite out of my power such a happy little circle as you find us here yes indeed charming young man that is so very friendly i mean good mr perry such attention to jane and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcome after a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess mrs elton speaking louder said yes here i am my good friend and here i have been so long that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise but the truth is that i am waiting for my lord and master he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr elton s time is so engaged upon my word it is miss bates he really is engaged from morning to night there is no end of people s coming to him on some pretence or other the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion they seem not able to do any thing without him upon my word mr e i often say rather you than i i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if i had half so many applicants bad enough as it is for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight however he is coming i assure you yes indeed on purpose to wait on you all and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma a congratulatory visit you know oh yes quite indispensable miss bates looked about her so happily he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation mr e is knightley s right hand emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is mr elton gone on foot to donwell he will have a hot walk oh no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting weston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only of those who lead i fancy mr e and knightley have every thing their own way have not you mistaken the day said emma i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow mr knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday oh no the meeting is certainly to day was the abrupt answer which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs elton s side i do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever was we never heard of such things at maple grove your parish there was small said jane upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject talked of but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than five and twenty children ah you clever creature that s very true what a thinking brain you have i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we could be shaken together my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection not that i presume to insinuate however that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already but hush not a word if you please it seemed an unnecessary caution jane was wanting to give her words not to mrs elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look mr elton made his appearance his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted mr elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away his civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the walk he had had for nothing when i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found very odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one donwell cried his wife my dear mr e you have not been to donwell you mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown no no that s to morrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley to day on that very account such a dreadful broiling morning i went over the fields too speaking in a tone of great ill usage which made it so much the worse and then not to find him at home i assure you i am not at all pleased and no apology left no message for me the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected very extraordinary and nobody knew at all which way he was gone perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods miss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley can you explain it emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him i cannot imagine said mrs elton feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten my dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he must not even knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never sent it i met william larkins continued mr elton as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him william seemed rather out of humour he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with william s wants but it really is of very great importance that _i_ should see knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly in all probability she was at this very time waited for there and mr knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr elton if not towards william larkins she was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of to say it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent oh cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure there would have been no danger the danger would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest indeed miss woodhouse speaking more collectedly with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to i have not time for half that i could wish to say i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself i feel it so very due but unfortunately in short if your compassion does not stand my friend oh you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly and taking her hand you owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you so cold and artificial i had always a part to act it was a life of deceit i know that i must have disgusted you pray say no more i feel that all the apologies should be on my side let us forgive each other at once we must do whatever is to be done quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor very and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose you just as i begin to know you oh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma smiling but excuse me it must be thought of the smile was returned as jane answered you are very right it has been thought of and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for thank you thank you this is just what i wanted to be assured of oh if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open good bye good bye chapter xvii mrs weston s friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased to emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabella s sons but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best it would be a great comfort to mr weston as he grew older and even mr weston might be growing older ten years hence to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home and mrs weston no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again she has had the advantage you know of practising on me she continued like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan that is replied mr knightley she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all it will be the only difference poor child cried emma at that rate what will become of her nothing very bad the fate of thousands she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma i who am owing all my happiness to _you_ would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them emma laughed and replied but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it do you i have no doubt nature gave you understanding miss taylor gave you principles you must have done well my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner i do not believe i did you any good the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least i am sure you were of use to me cried emma i was very often influenced rightly by you oftener than i would own at the time i am very sure you did me good and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks mr knightley i am going to do so and so papa says i may or i have miss taylor s leave something which you knew i did not approve in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one what an amiable creature i was no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance mr knightley you always called me mr knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound and yet it is formal i want you to call me something else but i do not know what i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again and cannot you call me george now impossible i never can call you any thing but mr knightley i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton by calling you mr k but i will promise she added presently laughing and blushing i will promise to call you once by your christian name i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where in the building in which n takes m for better for worse emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies her wilful intimacy with harriet smith but it was too tender a subject she could not enter on it harriet was very seldom mentioned between them this on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining she was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on isabella s letters he might observe that it was so the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to be consulted but since that business had been over she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before isabella to be sure was no very quick observer yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children it would not have escaped her emma s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on by harriet s being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be a month at least mr and mrs john knightley were to come down in august and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back john does not even mention your friend said mr knightley here is his answer if you like to see it it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned john enters like a brother into my happiness continued mr knightley but he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes he writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read the letter i honour his sincerity it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him my emma he means no such thing he only means he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two interrupted she with a sort of serious smile much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject emma my dear emma oh she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion depend upon it he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther ah he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together i am amused by one part of john s letter did you notice it where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying he had no idea of me he seems perfectly unprepared for that yes yes but i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings what has he been judging by i am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another but it was so i suppose i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual i remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons reception of it tried as soon as mrs weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr woodhouse s visits emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to announce it at home and then at randalls but how to break it to her father at last she had bound herself to do it in such an hour of mr knightley s absence or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her and she must have put it off but mr knightley was to come at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to make she was forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself she must not appear to think it a misfortune with all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all she and mr knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person s company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs weston best in the world poor man it was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it she was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of poor isabella and poor miss taylor but it would not do emma hung about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs weston whose marriages taking them from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change but she was not going from hartfield she should be always there she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having mr knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea did he not love mr knightley very much he would not deny that he did she was sure whom did he ever want to consult on business but mr knightley who was so useful to him who so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist him who so cheerful so attentive so attached to him would not he like to have him always on the spot yes that was all very true mr knightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see him every day but they did see him every day as it was why could not they go on as they had done mr woodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome the idea was given time and continual repetition must do the rest to emma s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr knightley s whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome and he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion they had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest approbation and mrs weston was ready on the first meeting to consider the subject in the most serviceable light first as a settled and secondly as a good one well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr woodhouse s mind it was agreed upon as what was to be and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other in another year or two perhaps it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place mrs weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event she had been extremely surprized never more so than when emma first opened the affair to her but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost she had such a regard for mr knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest emma and it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable a connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it long ago how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield and who but mr knightley could know and bear with mr woodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirable the difficulty of disposing of poor mr woodhouse had been always felt in her husband s plans and her own for a marriage between frank and emma how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impediment less acknowledged by mr weston than by herself but even he had never been able to h the subject better than by saying those matters will take care of themselves the young people will find a way but here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future it was all right all open all equal no sacrifice on any side worth the name it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it mrs weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections as these was one of the happiest women in the world if any thing could increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread and mr weston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind he saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it it is to be a secret i conclude said he these matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them only let me be told when i may speak out i wonder whether jane has any suspicion he went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on that point he told her the news was not she like a daughter his eldest daughter he must tell her and miss bates being present it passed of course to mrs cole mrs perry and mrs elton immediately afterwards it was no more than the principals were prepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls how soon it would be over highbury and were thinking of themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle with great sagacity in general it was a very well approved match some might think him and others might think her the most in luck one set might recommend their all removing to donwell and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys and another might predict disagreements among their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one habitation the vicarage there the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction mr elton cared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the young lady s pride would now be contented and supposed she had always meant to catch knightley if she could and on the point of living at hartfield could daringly exclaim rather he than i but mrs elton was very much discomposed indeed poor knightley poor fellow sad business for him she was extremely concerned for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities how could he be so taken in did not think him at all in love not in the least poor knightley there would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him but that would be all over now poor fellow no more exploring parties to donwell made for _her_ oh no there would be a mrs knightley to throw cold water on every thing extremely disagreeable but she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day shocking plan living together it would never do she knew a family near maple grove who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter chapter xviii time passed on a few more to morrows and the party from london would be arriving it was an alarming change and emma was thinking of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when mr knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by after the first chat of pleasure he was silent and then in a graver tone began with i have something to tell you emma some news good or bad said she quickly looking up in his face i do not know which it ought to be called oh good i am sure i see it in your countenance you are trying not to smile i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it indeed but why so i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which we do not think alike he paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on her face does nothing occur to you do not you recollect harriet smith her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though she knew not what have you heard from her yourself this morning cried he you have i believe and know the whole no i have not i know nothing pray tell me you are prepared for the worst i see and very bad it is harriet smith marries robert martin emma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared and her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible but her lips were closed it is so indeed continued mr knightley i have it from robert martin himself he left me not half an hour ago she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement you like it my emma as little as i feared i wish our opinions were the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it it seems an impossibility you cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again yet you only mean that he intends it i mean that he has done it answered mr knightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted good god she cried well then having recourse to her workbasket in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing she added well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me how where when let me know it all i never was more surprized but it does not make me unhappy i assure you how how has it been possible it is a very simple story he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s the party was to be our brother and sister henry john and miss smith my friend robert could not resist they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving he came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own this is all that i can relate of the how where and when your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her she will give you all the minute particulars which only woman s language can make interesting in our communications we deal only in the great however i must say that robert martin s heart seemed for _him_ and to _me_ very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astley s my brother took charge of mrs john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy he stopped emma dared not attempt any immediate reply to speak she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness she must wait a moment or he would think her mad her silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while he added emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected his situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more his good sense and good principles would delight you as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma you laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin he wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly she did cheerfully answering you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match i think harriet is doing extremely well _her_ connexions may be worse than _his_ in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unprepared i was for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before you ought to know your friend best replied mr knightley but i should say she was a good tempered soft hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i do but mr knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him i could suppose she might in time but can she already did not you misunderstand him you were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him it was not harriet s hand that he was certain of it was the dimensions of some famous ox the contrast between the countenance and air of mr knightley and robert martin was at this moment so strong to emma s feelings and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriet s side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis no i hope i know better than to think of robert martin that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature it could not be otherwise do you dare say this cried mr knightley do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of what do you deserve oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr martin and harriet now are i am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard i assured him that i could not then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day i am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles and most sincerely wish them happy you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before i hope so for at that time i was a fool and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet s good qualities i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martin s sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her i have often talked to her a good deal you must have seen that i did sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin s cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for me cried emma shaking her head ah poor harriet she checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father she was not sorry she wanted to be alone her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be collected she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits and till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she could be fit for nothing rational her father s business was to announce james s being gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harriet s welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security what had she to wish for nothing but to grow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst of them she must laugh at such a close such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back such a heart such a harriet now there would be pleasure in her returning every thing would be a pleasure it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr knightley would soon be over the disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father not always listening but always agreeing to what he said and whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day or poor mrs weston would be disappointed they arrived mrs weston was alone in the drawing room but hardly had they been told of the baby and mr woodhouse received the thanks for coming which he asked for when a glimpse was caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window it is frank and miss fairfax said mrs weston i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning he stays till to morrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us they are coming in i hope in half a minute they were in the room emma was extremely glad to see him but there was a degree of confusion a number of embarrassing recollections on each side they met readily and smiling but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure when mr weston joined the party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animation or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs weston s letters i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon i hope you do not retract what you then said no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness is not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards jane better than she ever used to do you see how my father and mrs weston doat upon her but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named the name of dixon emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing i can never think of it she cried without extreme shame the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be but is it possible that you had no suspicion i mean of late early i know you had none i never had the smallest i assure you that appears quite wonderful i was once very near and i wish i had it would have been better but though i was always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing it is not now worth a regret said emma i have some hope resumed he of my uncle s being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust till we may carry her northward but now i am at such a distance from her is not it hard miss woodhouse till this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation do not you pity me emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay thought he cried ah by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the moment i hope mr knightley is well he paused she coloured and laughed i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour let me return your congratulations i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane and his next words were did you ever see such a skin such smoothness such delicacy and yet without being actually fair one cannot call her fair it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye lashes and hair a most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly the lady in it just colour enough for beauty i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale when we first began to talk of her have you quite forgotten oh no what an impudent dog i was how could i dare but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could not help saying i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all i am sure you had i am sure it was a consolation to you oh no no no how can you suspect me of such a thing i was the most miserable wretch not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation i think there is a little likeness between us he bowed if not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of true sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own true true he answered warmly no not true on your side you can have no superior but most true on mine she is a complete angel look at her is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn of her throat observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father you will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels they are to be new set i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head will not it be beautiful in her dark hair very beautiful indeed replied emma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out how delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such excellent looks i would not have missed this meeting for the world i should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come the others had been talking of the child mrs weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under the evening before from the infant s appearing not quite well she believed she had been foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr perry perhaps she ought to be ashamed but mr weston had been almost as uneasy as herself in ten minutes however the child had been perfectly well again this was her history and particularly interesting it was to mr woodhouse who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry and only regretted that she had not done it she should always send for perry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment she could not be too soon alarmed nor send for perry too often it was a pity perhaps that he had not come last night for though the child seemed well now very well considering it would probably have been better if perry had seen it frank churchill caught the name perry said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss fairfax s eye my friend mr perry what are they saying about mr perry has he been here this morning and how does he travel now has he set up his carriage emma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined in the laugh it was evident from jane s countenance that she too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf such an extraordinary dream of mine he cried i can never think of it without laughing she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown look at her do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye that the whole blunder is spread before her that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others jane was forced to smile completely for a moment and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet steady voice how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me they _will_ sometimes obtrude but how you can court them he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but emma s feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on leaving randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of mr knightley s high superiority of character the happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced chapter xix if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr knightley and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty a very few days brought the party from london and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfied unaccountable as it was that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr knightley and was now forming all her views of happiness harriet was a little distressed did look a little foolish at first but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and self deceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to her friend s approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astley s and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight but what did such particulars explain the fact was as emma could now acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert martin and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible beyond this it must ever be unintelligible to emma the event however was most joyful and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so harriet s parentage became known she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to have always wished for concealment such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for it was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many a gentleman but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr knightley or for the churchills or even for mr elton the stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth would have been a stain indeed no objection was raised on the father s side the young man was treated liberally it was all as it should be and as emma became acquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend she had no doubt of harriet s happiness with any good tempered man but with him and in the home he offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and improvement she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself retired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness she would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out she would be respectable and happy and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man or if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins was less and less at hartfield which was not to be regretted the intimacy between her and emma must sink their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought to be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural manner before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction as no remembrances even connected with mr elton as he stood before them could impair perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw mr elton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself robert martin and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells the mr churchills were also in town and they were only waiting for november the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by emma and mr knightley they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield to allow them the fortnight s absence in a tour to the seaside which was the plan john and isabella and every other friend were agreed in approving it but mr woodhouse how was mr woodhouse to be induced to consent he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were almost hopeless a second allusion indeed gave less pain he began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent it a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation still however he was not happy nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughter s courage failed she could not bear to see him suffering to know him fancying himself neglected and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr knightleys that when once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she hesitated she could not proceed in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden illumination of mr woodhouse s mind or any wonderful change of his nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another way mrs weston s poultry house was robbed one night of all her turkeys evidently by the ingenuity of man other poultry yards in the neighbourhood also suffered pilfering was _housebreaking_ to mr woodhouse s fears he was very uneasy and but for the sense of his son in law s protection would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life the strength resolution and presence of mind of the mr knightleys commanded his fullest dependence while either of them protected him and his hartfield was safe but mr john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november the result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment she was able to fix her wedding day and mr elton was called on within a month from the marriage of mr and mrs robert martin to join the hands of mr knightley and miss woodhouse the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have no taste for finery or parade and mrs elton from the particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very inferior to her own very little white satin very few lace veils a most pitiful business selina would stare when she heard of it but in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union

            "sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened elliot of kellynch hall walter elliot born march 1 1760 married july 15 1784 elizabeth daughter of james stevenson esq of south park in the county of gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue elizabeth born june 1 1785 anne born august 9 1787 a still born son november 5 1789 mary born november 20 1791 precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer s hands but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of himself and his family these words after the date of mary s birth married december 16 1810 charles son and heir of charles musgrove esq of uppercross in the county of somerset and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff representing a borough in three successive parliaments exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with the arms and motto principal seat kellynch hall in the county of somerset and sir walter s handwriting again in this finale heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson of the second sir walter vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot s character vanity of person and of situation he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at fifty four was still a very fine man few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own lady elliot had been an excellent woman sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwards she had humoured or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot s death and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower the other a widow that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman _ does _ marry again than when she does _ not _ but sir walter s continuing in singleness requires explanation be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing which he had not been very much tempted to do elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of her mother s rights and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together most happily his two other children were of very inferior value mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way she was only anne to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued god daughter favourite and friend lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore _ given _ all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow s foot about lady russell s temples had long been a distress to him elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot s death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the chapter ii mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter would rather have the _ disagreeable _ prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it much serious consideration she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour but she was as desirous of saving sir walter s feelings as solicitous for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them herself the widow of only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations and she did what nobody else thought of doing she consulted anne who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter every emendation of anne s had been on the side of honesty against importance she wanted more vigorous measures a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell looking over her paper much may be done if he will adopt these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families have done or ought to do there will be nothing singular in his case and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering as it always does of our conduct i have great hope of prevailing we must be serious and decided for after all the person who has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father there is still more due to the character of an honest man this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding his friends to be urging him she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty she rated lady russell s influence highly and as to the severe degree of self denial which her own conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete than to half a reformation her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on through the whole list of lady russell s too gentle reductions how anne s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence lady russell s had no success at all could not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort of life knocked off journeys london servants horses table contractions and restrictions every where to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms quit kellynch hall the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter s retrenching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go was settled and the first outline of this important change made out there had been three alternatives london bath or another house in the country all anne s wishes had been for the latter a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russell s society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her ambition but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her and bath was to be her home sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell s spending some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne s known wishes it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter s feelings they must have been dreadful and with regard to anne s dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there after her mother s death and secondly from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must suit them all and as to her young friend s health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good anne had been too little from home too little seen her spirits were not high a larger society would improve them she wanted her to be more known the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning he was not only to quit his home but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude which stronger heads than sir walter s have found too much kellynch hall was to be let this however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house mr shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour that he would let it at all how quick come the reasons for approving what we like lady russell had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an unprosperous marriage to her father s house with the additional burden of two children she was a clever young woman who understood the art of pleasing the art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility from situation mrs clay was in lady russell s estimate a very unequal and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliot s reach was therefore an object of first rate importance chapter iii i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper that the present juncture is much in our favour this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore they will be all wanting a home could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants many a noble fortune has been made during the war if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying sir walter only nodded but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed sarcastically there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune said mrs clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clay s health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him here anne spoke the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow very true very true what miss anne says is very true was mr shepherd s rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughter s but sir walter s remark was soon afterwards the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds of objection to it first as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a man s youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man i have observed it all my life a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line one day last spring in town i was in company with two men striking instances of what i am talking of lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable looking personage you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top in the name of heaven who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near sir basil morley old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin what do you take his age to be sixty said i or perhaps sixty two forty replied sir basil forty and no more picture to yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin s age nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only _ their _ lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter s good will towards a naval officer as tenant had been gifted with foresight for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him that accidentally hearing it was just as he had foretold mr shepherd observed sir walter s concerns could not be kept a secret accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let and understanding his mr shepherd s connection with the owner he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant and who is admiral croft was sir walter s cold suspicious inquiry mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman s family and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed added he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale hearty well looking man a little weather beaten to be sure but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a ready furnished house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral s family which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant he was a married man and without children the very state to be wished for a house was never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady as where there were many children a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture in the world he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be continued he asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not hear the appeal i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer s man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed after waiting another moment you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne mr shepherd was all gratitude wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term _ gentleman _ i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter s estimate of the dues of a tenant it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing in the admiral s situation in life which was just high enough and not too high i have let my house to admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere _ mr _ a _ mr _ save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of explanation an admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said with a gentle sigh a few months more and _ he _ perhaps may be walking here chapter iv _ he _ was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire in the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkford he was at that time a remarkably fine young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste and feeling half the sum of attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in having them accepted a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one troubles soon arose sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away which she grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious youth killing dependence it must not be if by any fair interference of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother s love and mother s rights it would be prevented captain wentworth had no fortune he had been lucky in his profession but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing but he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still such confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil it only added a dangerous character to himself he was brilliant he was headstrong lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror she deprecated the connexion in every light such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat young and gentle as she was it might yet have been possible to withstand her father s ill will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it but it was not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it had she not imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up the belief of being prudent and self denying principally for _ his _ advantage was her chief consolation under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment he had left the country in consequence a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance but not with a few months ended anne s share of suffering from it her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory no second attachment the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society around them she had been solicited when about two and twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir walter s and of good character and appearance and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father s house and settled so permanently near herself but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne s being tempted by some man of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits they knew not each other s opinion either its constancy or its change on the one leading point of anne s conduct for the subject was never alluded to but anne at seven and twenty thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen she did not blame lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs without reference to the actual results of their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ and all that he had told her would follow had taken place he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy she had no reason to believe him married how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful confidence in futurity against that over anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence she had been forced into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning with all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworth s sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil she was assisted however by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell s motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft s really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his the brother only with whom he had been residing had received any information of their short lived engagement that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature s having heard of it from him the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness chapter v on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft s seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell s and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided the whole business at once each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality on the admiral s side as could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherd s assurances of his being known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right and mr shepherd s clerks were set to work without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the best looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be no harm in him reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country did not think that everything considered she wished to remain it would be most right and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others something occurred however to give her a different duty mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing that she should not have a day s health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath i cannot possibly do without anne was mary s reasoning and elizabeth s reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay this invitation of mary s removed all lady russell s difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs clay s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne in mrs clay s being of so much use while anne could be of none was a very sore aggravation anne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her father s character she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind mrs clay had freckles and a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young and certainly altogether well looking and possessed in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister she had little hope of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning she spoke and seemed only to offend elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each party s perfectly knowing their situation mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of hers and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clay s freckles there is hardly any personal defect replied anne which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good elizabeth though resenting the suspicion might yet be made observant by it the last office of the four carriage horses was to draw sir walter miss elliot and mrs clay to bath the party drove off in very good spirits sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves and anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where she was to spend the first week her friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt this break up of the family exceedingly their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage of lady russell s journey uppercross was a moderate sized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees substantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage enclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a pear tree trained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire it had received the improvement of a farm house elevated into a cottage for his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch the traveller s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on here anne had often been staying she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each other s house at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course though better endowed than the elder sister mary had not anne s understanding nor temper while well and happy and properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits but any indisposition sunk her completely she had no resources for solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot self importance was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill used in person she was inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached the dignity of being a fine girl she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing room the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers and two children and on anne s appearing greeted her with so you are come at last i began to think i should never see you i am so ill i can hardly speak i have not seen a creature the whole morning i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell so lady russell would not get out i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband oh charles is out shooting i have not seen him since seven o clock he would go though i told him how ill i was he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning you have had your little boys with you yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good little charles does not mind a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully you know i always cure you when i come how are your neighbours at the great house i can give you no account of them i have not seen one of them to day except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out of their way you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone it is early i never want them i assure you they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner dear me what can _ you _ possibly have to do a great many things i assure you more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father s books and pictures i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth s plants are for lady russell i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave i was told that they wished it but all these things took up a great deal of time oh well and after a moment s pause but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one s own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa and i think it very likely that my illness to day may be owing to it a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on anne s side produced nearly a cure on mary s she could soon sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner time then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough to propose a little walk where shall we go said she when they were ready i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible they ought to feel what is due to you as _ my _ sister however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have that over we can enjoy our walk anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it to the great house accordingly they went to sit the full half hour in the old fashioned square parlour with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano forte and a harp flower stands and little tables placed in every direction oh could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration perhaps of improvement the father and mother were in the old english style and the young people in the new mr and mrs musgrove were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable not much educated and not at all elegant their children had more modern minds and manners there was a numerous family but the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant they were of consequence at home and favourites abroad anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together that good humoured mutual affection of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters they were received with great cordiality nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family which was generally as anne very well knew the least to blame the half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both the miss musgroves at mary s particular invitation chapter vi anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove so miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath do you think they will settle in and this without much waiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of i hope _ we _ shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa if we do go we must be in a good situation none of your queen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary of upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away to be happy at bath she could only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell the mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy their own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping neighbours dress dancing and music she acknowledged it to be very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible she had no dread of these two months mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort she was always on friendly terms with her brother in law and in the children who loved her nearly as well and respected her a great deal more than their mother she had an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion charles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits as it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise trifled away without benefit from books or anything else he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by his wife s occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to anne s admiration and upon the whole though there was very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass for a happy couple they were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made he always contended for his father s having many other uses for his money and a right to spend it as he liked as to the management of their children his theory was much better than his wife s and his practice not so bad i could manage them very well if it were not for mary s interference was what anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in but when listening in turn to mary s reproach of charles spoils the children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had the smallest temptation to say very true one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house known to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested or at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill was charles s language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think there was anything the matter with me i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very ill a great deal worse than i ever own mary s declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with anne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing mrs charles had a little of your method with those children they are quite different creatures with you but to be sure in general they are so spoilt it is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen poor little dears without partiality but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated bless me how troublesome they are sometimes i assure you miss anne it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as i otherwise should i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment don t do this and don t do that or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them she had this communication moreover from mary mrs musgrove thinks all her servants so steady that it would be high treason to call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper house maid and laundry maid instead of being in their business are gadding about the village all day long i meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them if jemima were not the trustiest steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them and on mrs musgrove s side it was i make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter in law s concerns for i know it would not do but i shall tell _ you _ miss anne because you may be able to set things to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles s nursery maid i hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from my own knowledge i can declare she is such a fine dressing lady that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid of mentioning it again it was mary s complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined at the great house with other families and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said i have no scruple of observing to _ you _ how nonsensical some persons are about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world but i know it is taken notice of by many persons how was anne to set all these matters to rights she could do little more than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister s benefit in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well her own spirits improved by change of place and subject by being removed three miles from kellynch mary s ailments lessened by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse with the other family since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it was rather an advantage it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible for they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs musgrove s respectable forms in the usual places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others as she was well aware she knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation excepting one short period of her life she had never since the age of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world and mr and mrs musgrove s fond partiality for their own daughters performance and total indifference to any other person s gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification for her own the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company the neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited by everybody and had more dinner parties and more callers more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family they were more completely popular the girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally in an unpremeditated little ball there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures they would come at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else and often drew this compliment well done miss anne very well done indeed lord bless me how those little fingers of yours fly about so passed the first three weeks michaelmas came and now anne s heart must be in kellynch again a beloved home made over to others all the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects beginning to own other eyes and other limbs she could not think of much else on the 29th of september and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this the day the crofts were to come to kellynch i am glad i did not think of it before how low it makes me the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were to be visited mary deplored the necessity for herself nobody knew how much she should suffer she should put it off as long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated comfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going she wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned they came the master of the house was not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary and made himself very agreeable by his good humoured notice of her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice or in the turn of sentiment and expression mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness uprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face though her reddened and weather beaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight and thirty her manners were open easy and decided like one who had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of hing or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question she could not however reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for when the youngest miss musgrove walked in that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves was the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the piano forte i will tell you why she is out of spirits when the crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into mamma s head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard s captain at one time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved seldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thick headed unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name living or dead he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board captain frederick wentworth s frigate the laconia and from the laconia he had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters all the rest had been mere applications for money in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed and the re perusal of these letters after so long an interval her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death mr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first of being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it _ might _ that it probably _ would _ turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from clifton a very fine young man but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to anne s nerves she found however that it was one to which she must inure herself since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself to be insensible on such points and not only did it appear that he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect for his character stamped as it was by poor dick s having been six months under his care and mentioning him in strong though not perfectly well spelt praise as a fine dashing felow only two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as they could hear of his arrival the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening chapter vii a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross by the end of another week it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars but a week must pass only a week in anne s reckoning and then she supposed they must meet and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove s civility and she was all but calling there in the same half hour she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boy s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall the child s situation put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account his collar bone was found to be dislocated and such injury received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants her brother s return was the first comfort he could take best care of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now the collar bone was soon replaced and though mr robinson felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew s state as to give the information of captain wentworth s visit staying five minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all a favourite before how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow actually on the morrow and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought and in short he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came with their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give him the meeting oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen the child had a good night and was going on well the next day it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm and charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity for longer confinement the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him who could be of no use at home to shut himself up his father very much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house nothing can be going on better than the child said he so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain mary knew from charles s manner of speaking that he was quite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him she said nothing therefore till he was out of the room but as soon as there was only anne to hear so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all equal to it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mother s property her own feelings generally make it so i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves for the sort of thing but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening dear me that s a very good thought very good indeed to be sure i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home am i and it only harasses me you who have not a mother s feelings are a great deal the properest person you can make little charles do anything he always minds you at a word it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima oh i shall certainly go i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know you do not mind being left alone an excellent thought of yours indeed anne i will go and tell charles and get ready directly you can send for us you know at a moment s notice if anything is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child the next moment she was tapping at her husband s dressing room door and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for the whole conversation which began with mary s saying in a tone of great exultation i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him it is anne s own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday this is very kind of anne was her husband s answer and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits they were gone she hoped to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort as were perhaps ever likely to be hers she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself agreeable to others she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances he must be either indifferent or unwilling had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance and their visit in general there had been music singing talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all to know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being in mrs charles musgrove s way on account of the child and therefore somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles s being to meet him to breakfast at his father s anne understood it he wished to avoid seeing her he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps by the same view of escaping h her breakfast as she could it is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude the worst is over mary talked but she could not attend she had seen him they had met they had been once more in the same room soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness what might not eight years do events of every description changes alienations removals all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past how natural how certain too it included nearly a third part of her own life alas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing now how were his sentiments to be read was this like wishing to avoid her and the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense for after the miss musgroves had returned and hed their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive to me henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister s in a common way but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound altered beyond his knowledge anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for he was not altered or not for the worse she had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her as he would no the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages she had seen the same frederick wentworth so altered that he should not have known her again these were words which could not but dwell with her yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them they were of sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would be carried round to her he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal had spoken as he felt he had not forgiven anne elliot she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure she had given him up to oblige others it had been the effect of over persuasion it had been weakness and timidity he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again her power with him was gone for ever it was now his object to marry he was rich and being turned on shore fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow he had a heart for either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way excepting anne elliot this was his only secret exception when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy and i am a lost man should not this be enough for a sailor who has had no society among women to make him nice he said it she knew to be contradicted his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with a strong mind with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description that is the woman i want said he something a little inferior i shall of course put up with but it must not be much if i am a fool i shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject more than most men chapter viii from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the same circle they were soon dining in company together at mr musgrove s for the little boy s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each _ they _ could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement could not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth his profession qualified him his disposition lead him to talk and _ that _ was in the year six _ that _ happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself there must be the same immediate association of thought though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain they had no conversation together no intercourse but what the commonest civility required once so much to each other now nothing there _ had _ been a time when of all the large party now filling the drawing room at uppercross they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another with the exception perhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached and happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could never become acquainted it was a perpetual estrangement when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner of living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgrove s who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying ah miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son i dare say he would have been just such another by this time anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove relieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore could not keep pace with the conversation of the others when she could let her attention take its natural course again she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list their own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross and sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded your first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp you will not find her there quite worn out and broken up i was the last man who commanded her hardly fit for service then reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off to the west indies the girls looked all amazement the admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed phoo phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk never was a better sloop than the asp in her day for an old built sloop you would not see her equal lucky fellow to get her he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his i felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth seriously i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you i knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me anne s shudderings were to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to her do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case only nodded in reply and walked away the girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate and present non commissioned class observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean and i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for _ us _ when you were put captain into that ship _ we _ shall never forget what you did her feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth hearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more my brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking of poor richard poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth s face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove s kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too transient an indulgence of self amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent s feelings they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove it was no insignificant barrier indeed mrs musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment and while the agitations of anne s slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world but fair or not fair there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain which taste cannot tolerate which ridicule will seize the admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain wentworth and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts began with if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters should i i am glad i was not a week later then the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry he defended himself though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit which a few hours might comprehend but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort _ high _ and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it this brought his sister upon him oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether nothing to the purpose replied her brother you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then all merged in my friendship sophia i would assist any brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything of harville s from the world s end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable i might not like them the better for that perhaps such a number of women and children have no _ right _ to be comfortable on board my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days ah my dear said the admiral when he has got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife ay that we shall now i have done cried captain wentworth when once married people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it he got up and moved away what a great traveller you must have been ma am said mrs musgrove to mrs croft pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life and i do assure you ma am pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man of war i speak you know of the higher rates when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared thank god i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagrees with me a little disordered always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal when the admiral _ captain _ croft then was in the north seas i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs croft was mrs musgrove s hearty answer there is nothing so bad as a separation i am quite of your opinion _ i _ know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again the evening ended with dancing on its being proposed anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain wentworth she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference and especially the attention of all the young women could do the miss hayters the females of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who could wonder these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without consciousness _ once _ she felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered features perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him and _ once _ she knew that he must have spoken of her she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing she had rather play she is never tired of playing once too he spoke to her she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of unintentionally she returned to that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced to sit down again anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything chapter ix captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of the admiral s fraternal kindness as of his wife s he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off there was so much of friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfections of edward s wife upon credit a little longer it was soon uppercross with him almost every day the musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly in the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral and mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves in their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig lately added to their establishment hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth very much in the way charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth s h the interest of the story the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain benwick was now living with them entirely captain harville had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick s state of mind the sympathy and good will excited towards captain benwick was very great and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart than i have i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever he is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact younger as a man he will rally again and be happy with another they all met and were introduced captain harville was a tall dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame and from strong features and want of health looking much older than captain wentworth captain benwick looked and was the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air just as he ought to have and drew back from conversation captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging mrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly accepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to lyme without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon so unlike the usual style of give and take invitations and dinners of formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother officers these would have been all my friends was her thought and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness on quitting the cobb they all went in doors with their new friends and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many anne had a moment s astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville to turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies of lodging house furniture and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected the varieties in the fitting up of the rooms where the common necessaries provided by the owner in the common indifferent plight were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood excellently worked up and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented made it to her a something more or less than gratification captain harville was no reader but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of well bound volumes the property of captain benwick his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new netting needles and pins with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large fishing net at one corner of the room anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved they went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being so entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme and the no expectation of company had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in captain wentworth s company than she had at first imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it they never got beyond was become a mere nothing the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening and he came bringing his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers he ventured among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others it fell to anne s lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening s indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out of their conversation for though shy he did not seem reserved it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first rate poets trying to ascertain whether _ marmion _ or _ the lady of the lake _ were to be preferred and how ranked the _ giaour _ and _ the bride of abydos _ and moreover how the _ giaour _ was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines which imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion to his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested to particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists such collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances captain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for the interest implied and though with a shake of the head and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure and read them when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists and preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination chapter xii anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast they went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide which a fine south easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted they praised the morning gloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the fresh feeling breeze and were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with oh yes i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the sea air always does good there can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness last spring twelvemonth he declares himself that coming to lyme for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took and that being by the sea always makes him feel young again now i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely and fix at lyme do not you anne do not you agree with me that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of his having another seizure indeed i think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out from all the world i wish his friends would propose it to him i really think they ought and as to procuring a dispensation there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions over scrupulous i must say do not you think anne it is being over scrupulous do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties which may be just as well performed by another person and at lyme too only seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was anything to complain of anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate s being married i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion i wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate with dr shirley i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything i am afraid of her as i have told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross anne was amused by henrietta s manner of being grateful and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of henrietta s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family she had only time however for a general answer and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town they were all at her disposal when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back and stopped to give them way they ascended and passed him and as they passed anne s face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced it was evident that the gentleman completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it he gave her a momentary glance a glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you and even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again after attending louisa through her business and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining room had nearly run against the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves and determined that a well looking groom who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back should be his servant both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves and this second meeting short as it was also proved again by the gentleman s looks that he thought hers very lovely and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was a man of exceedingly good manners he seemed about thirty and though not handsome had an agreeable person anne felt that she should like to know who he was they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party to the window it was a gentleman s carriage a curricle but only coming round from the stable yard to the front door somebody must be going away it was driven by a servant in mourning the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused anne s curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off ah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne it is the very man we passed the miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table the waiter came into the room soon afterwards pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london elliot many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity of a waiter bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father s next heir pray sir turning to the waiter did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day there you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes but anne only conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me oh the great coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together said captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin when she could command mary s attention anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an h his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship and regard but by the tenderness of the past yes some share of the tenderness of the past she could not contemplate the change as implying less he must love her these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him without even trying to discern him when their places were determined on and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not her eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches anne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manœuvred so well with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object of colonel wallis s gallantry was quite contented anne s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening it was just occupation enough she had feelings for the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific and patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better at least during the first act towards the close of it in the interval succeeding an italian song she explained the words of the song to mr elliot they had a concert bill between them this said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing of the matter you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english you need not say anything more of your ignorance here is complete proof i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long replied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what we are to have next turning to the bill perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family i knew you by report long before you came to bath i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately i have been acquainted with you by character many years your person your disposition accomplishments manner they were all present to me mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people is irresistible and anne was all curiosity she wondered and questioned him eagerly but in vain he delighted in being asked but he would not tell no no some time or other perhaps but not now he would mention no names now but such he could assure her had been the fact he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford captain wentworth s brother he might have been in mr elliot s company but she had not courage to ask the question the name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change such she believed were his words but scarcely had she received their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial her father and lady dalrymple were speaking a well looking man said sir walter a very well looking man a very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple more air than one often sees in bath irish i dare say no i just know his name a bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of the navy his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch before sir walter had reached this point anne s eyes had caught the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance as her eyes fell on him his seemed to be withdrawn from her it had that appearance it seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance was recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward when she could give another glance he had moved away he could not have come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in but she would rather have caught his eye mr elliot s speech too distressed her she had no longer any inclination to talk to him she wished him not so near her the first act was over now she hoped for some beneficial change and after a period of nothing saying amongst the party some of them did decide on going in quest of tea anne was one of the few who did not choose to move she remained in her seat and so did lady russell but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean whatever she might feel on lady russell s account to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity she was persuaded by lady russell s countenance that she had seen him he did not come however anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance but he never came the anxious interval wore away unproductively the others returned the room filled again benches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look in re settling themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her colonel wallis declined sitting down again and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals and a little scheming of her own anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before much more within reach of a passer by she could not do so without comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles but still she did it and not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth was again in sight she saw him not far off he saw her too yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her she felt that something must be the matter the change was indubitable the difference between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room was strikingly great why was it she thought of her father of lady russell could there have been any unpleasant glances he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain wentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over anne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance improved and he replied again with almost a smile they talked for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round it came from mr elliot he begged her pardon but she must be applied to to explain italian again miss carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung anne could not refuse but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed and when her own mistress again when able to turn and look as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell he must wish her good night he was going he should get home as fast as he could is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for and he was gone directly jealousy of mr elliot it was the only intelligible motive captain wentworth jealous of her affection could she have believed it a week ago three hours ago for a moment the gratification was exquisite but alas there were very different thoughts to succeed how was such jealousy to be quieted how was the truth to reach him how in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations would he ever learn of her real sentiments it was misery to think of mr elliot s attentions their evil was incalculable chapter xxi anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid mr elliot was almost a first object she felt a great deal of good will towards him in spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which he seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation by his own sentiments by his early prepossession it was altogether very extraordinary flattering but painful there was much to regret how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case was not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad her affection would be his for ever their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation prettier musings of high wrought love and eternal constancy could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way she was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her though it had been an appointment an account of the concert was immediately claimed and anne s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it all that she could tell she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath was well know by name to mrs smith the little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed they never miss a concert yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them i do not know i do not think they were old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her she never misses i know and you must have seen her she must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur round the orchestra of course no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about that the object only had been deficient no no you were better employed you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening i see it in your eye i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to in the intervals of the concert it was conversation anne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye yes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together a blush overspread anne s cheeks she could say nothing and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning it is really very good of you to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time anne heard nothing of this she was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend s penetration unable to imagine how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her after another short silence pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me does he know that i am in bath mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised a moment s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under she caught it instantaneously and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely but it seems worn out now it is a great while since we met i was not at all aware of this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot s good fortune no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week i am not going to marry mr elliot i should like to know why you imagine i am mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her head and exclaimed now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that s all let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much but less would hardly have been sufficient mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon in mr elliot s failure but from the perception of there being a somebody else as it was she instantly submitted and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have received the idea or from whom she could have heard it do tell me how it first came into your head it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago and has it indeed been spoken of did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history the whole history repeated anne laughing she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news mrs smith said nothing but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years i did not before he was married i suppose yes he was not married when i knew him first and were you much acquainted intimately indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man was he at all such as he appears now i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith s answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful at last i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black anne s astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manner she added my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put nay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from she checked herself just in time this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night cried anne this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character mrs smith hesitated a little here oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty but was not she a very low woman yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it this was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wells and dated from london as far back as july 1803 dear smith i have received yours your kindness almost overpowers me i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have lived three and twenty years in the world and have seen none like it at present believe me i have no need of your services being in cash again give me joy i have got rid of sir walter and miss they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer the baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again he is quite fool enough if he does however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion he is worse than last year i wish i had any name but elliot i am sick of it the name of walter i can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me with my second w again meaning for the rest of my life to be only yours truly wm elliot such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father she was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over and say thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling can you really yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis colonel wallis you are acquainted with him no it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived i know you did i know it all perfectly but indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme i happened to be at lyme well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say and she continued this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manœuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not lessening i understand replied mrs smith he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it why to be sure ma am said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little thoughtfulness it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness but mr elliot was not done with mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both in justice and compassion she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliot s marriage they had been as before always together and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance from his wife s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised by him mr elliot raised by his marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself for with all his self indulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend s probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingly had been ruined the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliot s had better not be tried but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known with a confidence in mr elliot s regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hard hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments that no flagrant open crime could have been worse she had a great deal to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend s usual state of mind there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west indies which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures and this property though not large would be enough to make her comparatively rich but there was nobody to stir in it mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims was hard to bear it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne s good offices with mr elliot she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne s feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliot s character would allow when anne s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything and while it took from her the new formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation she had seemed to recommend and praise him my dear was mrs smith s reply there was nothing else to be done i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he had been your husband my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless he was very unkind to his first wife they were wretched together but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her i was willing to hope that you must fare better anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell and under such a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had disclosed all too late it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved chapter xxii anne went home to think over all that she had heard in one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him he stood as opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed pity for him was all over but this was the only point of relief in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of them she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was a reward indeed springing from it mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done could the knowledge have been extended through her family but this was a vain idea she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her and having done her best wait the event with as much composure as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however to turn her eyes towards anne exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son oh i lay no embargo on any body s words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day to morrow i had compassion on him anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she saw insincerity in everything his attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along she was accordingly more guarded and more cool than she had been the night before he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin s vanity he found at least that it was not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too commanding claims of the others he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath the next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part of two days he was invited again to camden place the very evening of his return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them mrs clay s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded for the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliot s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk of spending the morning in rivers street very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and pretend i have read it through i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out lady russell quite bores one with her new publications you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert something so formal and _ arrangé _ in her air and she sits so upright my best love of course and mine added sir walter kindest regards and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately while her father spoke there was a knock at the door who could it be anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were at the white hart so much was pretty soon understood but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into the other drawing room and regaling themselves with her admiration anne could not draw upon charles s brain for a regular history of their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta and captain harville beside their two selves he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding the scheme had received its first impulse by captain harville s wanting to come to bath on business he had begun to talk of it a week ago and by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed coming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear to be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end but then it had been taken up by his father and mother his mother had some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding clothes for herself and her sister and in short it ended in being his mother s party that everything might be comfortable and easy to captain harville and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience they had arrived late the night before mrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross anne s only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough for henrietta s wedding clothes to be talked of she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that very recently since mary s last letter to herself charles hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years and that on the strength of his present income with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question the two families had consented to the young people s wishes and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months quite as soon as louisa s and a very good living it was charles added only five and twenty miles from uppercross and in a very fine country fine part of dorsetshire in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get a special recommendation not that he will value it as he ought he observed charles is too cool about sporting that s the worst of him i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me mary does not above half like henrietta s match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to the value of the property it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne should be happy in their children s marriages they do everything to confer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long anne could not help laughing that cannot be much to your taste i know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read he is a brave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in my father s great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles s following the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none of the ill will of envy in it she would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs the visit passed off altogether in high good humour mary was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law s carriage with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they were detailed to her she had no demands on her father or sister and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing rooms elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style the reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch it was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better and then elizabeth was happy again these were her internal persuasions old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does did not even ask her own sister s family though they were here a month and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove put her quite out of her way i am sure she would rather not come she cannot feel easy with us i will ask them all for an evening that will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat they have not seen two such drawing rooms before they will be delighted to come to morrow evening it shall be a regular party small but most elegant and this satisfied elizabeth and when the invitation was given to the two present and promised for the absent mary was as completely satisfied she was particularly asked to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not have received a more gratifying attention miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning and anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her and henrietta directly her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes but anne convinced herself that a day s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn with an eagerness of good will which many associations contributed to form they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves and anne had the kindest welcome from each henrietta was exactly in that state of recently improved views of fresh formed happiness which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all and mrs musgrove s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress it was a heartiness and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more from the sad want of such blessings at home she was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance and on charles s leaving them together was listening to mrs musgrove s history of louisa and to henrietta s of herself giving opinions on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying to convince her that she was not ill used by anybody which mary well amused as she generally was in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have her moments of imagining a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected a large party in an hotel ensured a quick changing unsettled scene one five minutes brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there half an hour when their dining room spacious as it was seemed more than half filled a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with captains harville and wentworth the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had hastened him away from the concert room still governed he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand each other ere long we are not boy and girl to be captiously irritable misled by every moment s inadvertence and wantonly playing with our own happiness and yet a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company with each other under their present circumstances could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now they seemed deep in talk who is it come and tell me good heavens i recollect it is mr elliot himself no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till to morrow as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne to come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir and tried to be cool and unconcerned her distress returned however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves quite in the secret it was evident that the report concerning her had spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther do come anne cried mary come and look yourself you will be too late if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about lyme to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment anne did move quietly to the window she was just in time to ascertain that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well the visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with well mother i have done something for you that you will like i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night a n t i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play have not i done well mother mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful phoo phoo replied charles what s an evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like but i shall go to the play oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy there was no promise but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my father s heir the future representative of the family don t talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me the careless expression was life to anne who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles to herself charles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her mrs musgrove interposed we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying if it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home excepting on mary s account would not be the smallest impediment i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps she had spoken it but she trembled when it was done conscious that her words were listened to and daring not even to try to observe their effect it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife by persisting that he would go to the play to morrow if nobody else would captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire place probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a station with less bare faced design by anne you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy the evening parties of the place oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me i am no card player you were not formerly i know you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction after waiting a few moments he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling it is a period indeed eight years and a half is a period whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else should come in they were obliged to move anne talked of being perfectly ready and tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection wherewith to pity her their preparations however were stopped short alarming sounds were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give a general chill anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same the comfort the freedom the gaiety of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister how mortifying to feel that it was so her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure the sequel explained it after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves to morrow evening to meet a few friends no formal party it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had provided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and one card more decidedly for captain wentworth the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his the past was nothing the present was that captain wentworth would move about well in her drawing room the card was pointedly given and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out but not to anne she could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance she knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement for all the insolence of the past her spirits sank he held the card in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it only think of elizabeth s including everybody whispered mary very audibly i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted you see he cannot put the card out of his hand anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her the party separated the gentlemen had their own pursuits the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while anne belonged to them she was earnestly begged to return and dine and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow s party the frequent enumeration of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in bath while harassing herself with the never ending question of whether captain wentworth would come or not they were reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together she generally thought he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs clay s face as she listened it was transient cleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on sir walter she exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature oh dear very true only think miss elliot to my great surprise i met with mr elliot in bath street i was never more astonished he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard he had been prevented setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to morrow he was full of to morrow and it is very evident that i have been full of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head chapter xxiii one day only had passed since anne s conversation with mrs smith but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched by mr elliot s conduct except by its effects in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer her explanatory visit in rivers street she had promised to be with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner her faith was plighted and mr elliot s character like the sultaness scheherazade s head must live another day she could not keep her appointment punctually however the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain on her friends account and felt it very much on her own before she was able to attempt the walk when she reached the white hart and made her way to the proper apartment she found herself neither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there till they returned she had only to submit sit down be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed there was no delay no waste of time she was deep in the happiness of such misery or the misery of such happiness instantly two minutes after her entering the room captain wentworth said we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials materials were at hand on a separate table he went to it and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest daughter s engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again to talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style of open hearted communication minutiae which even with every advantage of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give could be properly interesting only to the principals mrs croft was attending with great good humour and whenever she spoke at all it was very sensibly anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self occupied to hear and so ma am all these thing considered said mrs musgrove in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual oh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her h her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement it is what i always protested against for my children it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement yes dear ma am said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can anne found an unexpected interest here she felt its application to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table captain wentworth s pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look one quick conscious look at her the two ladies continued to talk to re urge the same admitted truths and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear her mind was in confusion captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood he looked at her with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed come to me i have something to say and the unaffected easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was strongly enforced the invitation she roused herself and went to him the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer to captain wentworth s table not very near as she joined him captain harville s countenance re assumed the serious thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying a small miniature painting do you know who that is certainly captain benwick yes and you may guess who it is for but in a deep tone it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth he is writing about it now and with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon no replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe it was not in her nature she doted on him it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that for your sex and she answered the question smiling also yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature man s nature which has done the business for captain benwick no no it is not man s nature i will not allow it to be more man s nature than woman s to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the heaviest weather your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed with a faltering voice if woman s feelings were to be added to all this we shall never agree upon this question captain harville was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention to captain wentworth s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think he could have caught have you hed your letter said captain harville not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied and want for nothing no hurry for a signal at all well miss elliot lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably but let me observe that all histories are against you all stories prose and verse if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman s inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of woman s fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything but how shall we prove anything we never shall we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said ah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth s absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own with emotion oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long as if i may be allowed the expression so long as you have an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart was too full her breath too much oppressed you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand on her arm quite affectionately there is no quarrelling with you and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied their attention was called towards the others mrs croft was taking leave here frederick you and i part company i believe said she i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party turning to anne we had your sister s card yesterday and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either could not or would not answer fully yes said he very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute mrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter with great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried agitated air which shewed impatience to be gone anne knew not how to understand it she had the kindest good morning god bless you from captain harville but from him not a word nor a look he had passed out of the room without a look she had only time however to move closer to the table where he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning the door opened it was himself he begged their pardon but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it the work of an instant the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost beyond expression the letter with a direction hardly legible to miss a e was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick he had been also addressing her on the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her anything was possible anything might be defied rather than suspense mrs musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection she must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written her eyes devoured the following words i can listen no longer in silence i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach you pierce my soul i am half agony half hope tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone for ever i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlier death i have loved none but you unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been but never inconstant you alone have brought me to bath for you alone i think and plan have you not seen this can you fail to have understood my wishes i had not waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have penetrated mine i can hardly write i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me you sink your voice but i can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others too good too excellent creature you do us justice indeed you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in f w i must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither or follow your party as soon as possible a word a look will be enough to decide whether i enter your father s house this evening or never such a letter was not to be soon recovered from half an hour s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints of her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity every moment rather brought fresh agitation it was overpowering happiness and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation charles mary and henrietta all came in the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself they could then see that she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not stir without her for the world this was dreadful would they only have gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting and in desperation she said she would go home by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk but the chair would never do worse than all to lose the possibility of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him could not be borne the chair was earnestly protested against and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall in the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on finding her better at night anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word captain harville has no thought but of going do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me to be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss anne s message but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged i ll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity it could not be very lasting however even if he did not come to camden place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by captain harville another momentary vexation occurred charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her there was no preventing him this was almost cruel but she could not be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith s to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight of captain wentworth he joined them but as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked anne could command herself enough to receive that look and not repulsively the cheeks which had been pale now glowed and the movements which had hesitated were decided he walked by her side presently struck by a sudden thought charles said captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop there could not be an objection there could be only the most proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again and the other two proceeding together and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow there they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything but which had been followed by so many many years of division and estrangement there they returned again into the past more exquisitely happy perhaps in their re union than when it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed in a knowledge of each other s character truth and attachment more equal to act more justified in acting and there as they slowly paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers flirting girls nor nursery maids and children they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest all the little variations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday and to day there could scarcely be an end she had not mistaken him jealousy of mr elliot had been the retarding weight the doubt the torment that had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do in the last four and twenty hours it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks or words or actions occasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified he persisted in having loved none but her she had never been supplanted he never even believed himself to see her equal thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been constant unconsciously nay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it to be done he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been a sufferer from them her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun to understand himself at lyme he had received lessons of more than one sort the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harville s had fixed her superiority in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove the attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care for louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection which followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which louisa s could so ill bear a comparison or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self will between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind there he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun to deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way from that period his penance had become severe he had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of louisa s accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again than he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty i found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences he found too late in short that he had entangled himself and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed it determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere he would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore to his brother s meaning after a while to return to kellynch and act as circumstances might require i was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter anne smiled and let it pass it was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach it is something for a woman to be assured in her eight and twentieth year that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be the result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with benwick here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said but the concert still more that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments the moment of her stepping forward in the octagon room to speak to him the moment of mr elliot s appearing and tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on with energy to see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me you should have distinguished replied anne you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit was to be added i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house could have conceived all the surprise and suspense and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation she re entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last an interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high wrought felicity and she went to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment the evening came the drawing rooms were lighted up the company assembled it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found an evening shorter glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him the wallises she had amusement in understanding them lady dalrymple and miss carteret they would soon be innoxious cousins to her she cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister with the musgroves there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville the kind hearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal and with captain wentworth some moments of communications continually occurring and always the hope of more and always the knowledge of his being there it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman s portion he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her replied as if in cool deliberation not yet but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time i trust to being in charity with her soon but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter would you in short have renewed the engagement then would i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough good god he cried you would it is not that i did not think of it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success but i was proud too proud to ask again i did not understand you i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself six years of separation and suffering might have been spared it is a sort of pain too which is new to me i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i enjoyed i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards like other great men under reverses he added with a smile i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve chapter xxiv who can be in doubt of what followed when any two young people take it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other s ultimate comfort this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind consciousness of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every opposition they might in fact have borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned captain wentworth with five and twenty thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him was no longer nobody he was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which providence had placed him and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from thinking it a bad match for her on the contrary when he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight and eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank and all this assisted by his well sounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen with a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was lady russell anne knew that lady russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with and do justice to captain wentworth this however was what lady russell had now to do she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each that because captain wentworth s manners had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because mr elliot s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well regulated mind there was nothing less for lady russell to do than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment of character a natural penetration in short which no experience in others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend but she was a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible and well judging her first was to see anne happy she loved anne better than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance it was creditable to have a sister married and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn and as her own sister must be better than her husband s sisters it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain benwick or charles hayter she had something to suffer perhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored to the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette but she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate no headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation for a change is not very probable there she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him the news of his cousin anne s engagement burst on mr elliot most unexpectedly it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness which a son in law s rights would have given but though discomfited and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment he soon quitted bath and on mrs clay s quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established under his protection in london it was evident how double a game he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman at least mrs clay s affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed for the young man s sake the possibility of scheming longer for sir walter she has abilities however as well as affections and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers may finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of sir william it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of their deception in her they had their great cousins to be sure to resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others without being flattered and followed in turn is but a state of half enjoyment anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russell s meaning to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value there she felt her own inferiority very keenly the disproportion in their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moment s regret but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly nothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity she had but two friends in the world to add to his list lady russell and mrs smith to those however he was very well disposed to attach himself lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions he could now value from his heart while he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour and as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves and their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend secured her two she was their earliest visitor in their settled life and captain wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering her husband s property in the west indies by writing for her acting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend fully requited the services which she had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife mrs smith s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income with some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends to be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy and yet be happy her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits as her friend anne s was in the warmth of her heart anne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it in captain wentworth s affection his profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine she gloried in being a sailor s wife but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance \n",

            "no one who had ever seen catherine morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine her situation in life the character of her father and mother her own person and disposition were all equally against her her father was a clergyman without being neglected or poor and a very respectable man though his name was richard and he had never been handsome he had a considerable independence besides two good livings and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters her mother was a woman of useful plain sense with a good temper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution she had three sons before catherine was born and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world as anybody might expect she still lived on lived to have six children more to see them growing up around her and to enjoy excellent health herself a family of ten children will be always called a fine family where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number but the morlands had little other right to the word for they were in general very plain and catherine for many years of her life as plain as any she had a thin awkward figure a sallow skin without colour dark lank hair and strong features so much for her person and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind she was fond of all boys plays and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy nursing a dormouse feeding a canary bird or watering a rose bush indeed she had no taste for a garden and if she gathered flowers at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take such were her propensities her abilities were quite as extraordinary she never could learn or understand anything before she was taught and sometimes not even then for she was often inattentive and occasionally stupid her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the beggar s petition and after all her next sister sally could say it better than she did not that catherine was always stupid by no means she learnt the fable of the hare and many friends as quickly as any girl in england her mother wished her to learn music and catherine was sure she should like it for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet so at eight years old she began she learnt a year and could not bear it and mrs morland who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste allowed her to leave off the day which dismissed the music master was one of the happiest of catherine s life her taste for drawing was not superior though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper she did what she could in that way by drawing houses and trees hens and chickens all very much like one another writing and accounts she was taught by her father french by her mother her proficiency in either was not remarkable and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could what a strange unaccountable character for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper was seldom stubborn scarcely ever quarrelsome and very kind to the little ones with few interruptions of tyranny she was moreover noisy and wild hated confinement and cleanliness and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house such was catherine morland at ten at fifteen appearances were mending she began to curl her hair and long for balls her complexion improved her features were softened by plumpness and colour her eyes gained more animation and her figure more consequence her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery and she grew clean as she grew smart she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement catherine grows quite a good looking girl she is almost pretty to day were words which caught her ears now and then and how welcome were the sounds to look _ almost _ pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive mrs morland was a very good woman and wished to see her children everything they ought to be but her time was so much occupied in lying in and teaching the little ones that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves and it was not very wonderful that catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket baseball riding on horseback and running about the country at the age of fourteen to books or at least books of information for provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them provided they were all story and no reflection she had never any objection to books at all but from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives from pope she learnt to censure those who bear about the mockery of woe from gray that many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its fragrance on the desert air from thomson that it is a delightful task to teach the young idea how to shoot and from shakespeare she gained a great store of information amongst the rest that trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmation strong as proofs of holy writ that the poor beetle which we tread upon in corporal sufferance feels a pang as great as when a giant dies and that a young woman in love always looks like patience on a monument smiling at grief so far her improvement was sufficient and in many other points she came on exceedingly well for though she could not write sonnets she brought herself to read them and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte of her own composition she could listen to other people s performance with very little fatigue her greatest deficiency was in the pencil she had no notion of drawing not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover s profile that she might be detected in the design there she fell miserably short of the true heroic height at present she did not know her own poverty for she had no lover to portray she had reached the age of seventeen without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility without having inspired one real passion and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient this was strange indeed but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out there was not one lord in the neighbourhood no not even a baronet there was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door not one young man whose origin was unknown her father had no ward and the squire of the parish no children but when a young lady is to be a heroine the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way mr allen who owned the chief of the property about fullerton the village in wiltshire where the morlands lived was ordered to bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution and his lady a good humoured woman fond of miss morland and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village she must seek them abroad invited her to go with them mr and mrs morland were all compliance and catherine all happiness chapter 2 in addition to what has been already said of catherine morland s personal and mental endowments when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks residence in bath it may be stated for the reader s more certain information lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be that her heart was affectionate her disposition cheerful and open without conceit or affectation of any kind her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl her person pleasing and when in good looks pretty and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is when the hour of departure drew near the maternal anxiety of mrs morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe a thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm house must at such a moment relieve the fulness of her heart who would not think so but mrs morland knew so little of lords and baronets that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations her cautions were confined to the following points i beg catherine you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat when you come from the rooms at night and i wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend i will give you this little book on purpose sally or rather sarah for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister it is remarkable however that she neither insisted on catherine s writing by every post nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance nor a detail of every interesting conversation that bath might produce everything indeed relative to this important journey was done on the part of the morlands with a degree of moderation and composure which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life than with the refined susceptibilities the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite her father instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker or even putting an hundred pounds bank bill into her hands gave her only ten guineas and promised her more when she wanted it under these unpromising auspices the parting took place and the journey began it was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety neither robbers nor tempests befriended them nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on mrs allen s side of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn and that fortunately proved to be groundless they arrived at bath catherine was all eager delight her eyes were here there everywhere as they approached its fine and striking environs and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel she was come to be happy and she felt happy already they were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in pulteney street it is now expedient to give some description of mrs allen that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work and how she will probably contribute to reduce poor catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable whether by her imprudence vulgarity or jealousy whether by intercepting her letters ruining her character or turning her out of doors mrs allen was one of that numerous class of females whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them she had neither beauty genius accomplishment nor manner the air of a gentlewoman a great deal of quiet inactive good temper and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible intelligent man like mr allen in one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be dress was her passion she had a most harmless delight in being fine and our heroine s entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn and her chaperon was provided with a dress of the newest fashion catherine too made some purchases herself and when all these matters were arranged the important evening came which was to usher her into the upper rooms her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand her clothes put on with care and both mrs allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do with such encouragement catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd as for admiration it was always very welcome when it came but she did not depend on it mrs allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late the season was full the room crowded and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could as for mr allen he repaired directly to the card room and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves with more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protégée mrs allen made her way through the throng of men by the door as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow catherine however kept close at her side and linked her arm too firmly within her friend s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly but to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd it seemed rather to increase as they went on whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience but this was far from being the case and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room their situation was just the same they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies still they moved on something better was yet in view and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench here there was something less of crowd than below and hence miss morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her and of all the dangers of her late passage through them it was a splendid sight and she began for the first time that evening to feel herself at a ball she longed to dance but she had not an acquaintance in the room mrs allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly every now and then i wish you could dance my dear i wish you could get a partner for some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes but they were repeated so often and proved so totally ineffectual that catherine grew tired at last and would thank her no more they were not long able however to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained everybody was shortly in motion for tea and they must squeeze out like the rest catherine began to feel something of disappointment she was tired of being continually pressed against by people the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives and when at last arrived in the tea room she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join no acquaintance to claim no gentleman to assist them they saw nothing of mr allen and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation were obliged to sit down at the end of a table at which a large party were already placed without having anything to do there or anybody to speak to except each other mrs allen congratulated herself as soon as they were seated on having preserved her gown from injury it would have been very shocking to have it torn said she would not it it is such a delicate muslin for my part i have not seen anything i like so well in the whole room i assure you how uncomfortable it is whispered catherine not to have a single acquaintance here yes my dear replied mrs allen with perfect serenity it is very uncomfortable indeed what shall we do the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here we seem forcing ourselves into their party aye so we do that is very disagreeable i wish we had a large acquaintance here i wish we had _ any _ it would be somebody to go to very true my dear and if we knew anybody we would join them directly the skinners were here last year i wish they were here now had not we better go away as it is here are no tea things for us you see no more there are indeed how very provoking but i think we had better sit still for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd how is my head my dear somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid no indeed it looks very nice but dear mrs allen are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people i think you _ must _ know somebody i don t upon my word i wish i did i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner i should be so glad to have you dance there goes a strange looking woman what an odd gown she has got on how old fashioned it is look at the back after some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours it was thankfully accepted and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening till they were discovered and joined by mr allen when the dance was over well miss morland said he directly i hope you have had an agreeable ball very agreeable indeed she replied vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn i wish she had been able to dance said his wife i wish we could have got a partner for her i have been saying how glad i should be if the skinners were here this winter instead of last or if the parrys had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry i am so sorry she has not had a partner we shall do better another evening i hope was mr allen s consolation the company began to disperse when the dancing was over enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort and now was the time for a heroine who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening to be noticed and admired every five minutes by removing some of the crowd gave greater openings for her charms she was now seen by many young men who had not been near her before not one however started with rapturous wonder on beholding her no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room nor was she once called a divinity by anybody yet catherine was in very good looks and had the company only seen her three years before they would _ now _ have thought her exceedingly handsome she _ was _ looked at however and with some admiration for in her own hearing two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl such words had their due effect she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before her humble vanity was contented she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms and went to her chair in good humour with everybody and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention chapter 3 every morning now brought its regular duties shops were to be visited some new part of the town to be looked at and the pump room to be attended where they paraded up and down for an hour looking at everybody and speaking to no one the wish of a numerous acquaintance in bath was still uppermost with mrs allen and she repeated it after every fresh proof which every morning brought of her knowing nobody at all they made their appearance in the lower rooms and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine the master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentleman like young man as a partner his name was tilney he seemed to be about four or five and twenty was rather tall had a pleasing countenance a very intelligent and lively eye and if not quite handsome was very near it his address was good and catherine felt herself in high luck there was little leisure for speaking while they danced but when they were seated at tea she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being he talked with fluency and spirit and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested though it was hardly understood by her after chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them he suddenly addressed her with i have hitherto been very remiss madam in the proper attentions of a partner here i have not yet asked you how long you have been in bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the upper rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether i have been very negligent but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars if you are i will begin directly you need not give yourself that trouble sir no trouble i assure you madam then forming his features into a set smile and affectedly softening his voice he added with a simpering air have you been long in bath madam about a week sir replied catherine trying not to laugh really with affected astonishment why should you be surprised sir why indeed said he in his natural tone but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam never sir indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms yes sir i was there last monday have you been to the theatre yes sir i was at the play on tuesday to the concert yes sir on wednesday and are you altogether pleased with bath yes i like it very well now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again catherine turned away her head not knowing whether she might venture to laugh i see what you think of me said he gravely i shall make but a poor figure in your journal to morrow my journal yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense indeed i shall say no such thing shall i tell you what you ought to say if you please i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him _ that _ madam is what i _ wish _ you to say but perhaps i keep no journal perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenor of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal i have sometimes thought said catherine doubtingly whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars and what are they a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way i should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes in every power of which taste is the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes they were interrupted by mrs allen my dear catherine said she do take this pin out of my sleeve i am afraid it has torn a hole already i shall be quite sorry if it has for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard that is exactly what i should have guessed it madam said mr tilney looking at the muslin do you understand muslins sir particularly well i always buy my own cravats and am allowed to be an excellent judge and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it i gave but five shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin mrs allen was quite struck by his genius men commonly take so little notice of those things said she i can never get mr allen to know one of my gowns from another you must be a great comfort to your sister sir i hope i am madam and pray sir what do you think of miss morland s gown it is very pretty madam said he gravely examining it but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray how can you said catherine laughing be so she had almost said strange i am quite of your opinion sir replied mrs allen and so i told miss morland when she bought it but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes mr tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced catherine feared as she listened to their discourse that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others what are you thinking of so earnestly said he as they walked back to the ballroom not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory catherine coloured and said i was not thinking of anything that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me well then i will not thank you for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much they danced again and when the assembly closed parted on the lady s side at least with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance whether she thought of him so much while she drank her warm wine and water and prepared herself for bed as to dream of him when there cannot be ascertained but i hope it was no more than in a slight slumber or a morning doze at most for if it be true as a celebrated writer has maintained that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman s love is declared 1 it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her how proper mr tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered mr allen s head but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was and had been assured of mr tilney s being a clergyman and of a very respectable family in gloucestershire 1 vide a letter from mr richardson no 97 vol ii rambler chapter 4 with more than usual eagerness did catherine hasten to the pump room the next day secure within herself of seeing mr tilney there before the morning were over and ready to meet him with a smile but no smile was demanded mr tilney did not appear every creature in bath except himself was to be seen in the room at different periods of the fashionable hours crowds of people were every moment passing in and out up the steps and down people whom nobody cared about and nobody wanted to see and he only was absent what a delightful place bath is said mrs allen as they sat down near the great clock after parading the room till they were tired and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here this sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that mrs allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now but we are told to despair of nothing we would attain as unwearied diligence our point would gain and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age who was sitting by her and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes addressed her with great complaisance in these words i think madam i cannot be mistaken it is a long time since i had the pleasure of seeing you but is not your name allen this question answered as it readily was the stranger pronounced hers to be thorpe and mrs allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages and that many years ago their joy on this meeting was very great as well it might since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years compliments on good looks now passed and after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together how little they had thought of meeting in bath and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families sisters and cousins talking both together far more ready to give than to receive information and each hearing very little of what the other said mrs thorpe however had one great advantage as a talker over mrs allen in a family of children and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons and the beauty of her daughters when she related their different situations and views that john was at oxford edward at merchant taylors and william at sea and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were mrs allen had no similar information to give no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions consoling herself however with the discovery which her keen eyes soon made that the lace on mrs thorpe s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own here come my dear girls cried mrs thorpe pointing at three smart looking females who arm in arm were then moving towards her my dear mrs allen i long to introduce them they will be so delighted to see you the tallest is isabella my eldest is not she a fine young woman the others are very much admired too but i believe isabella is the handsomest the miss thorpes were introduced and miss morland who had been for a short time forgotten was introduced likewise the name seemed to strike them all and after speaking to her with great civility the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest how excessively like her brother miss morland is the very picture of him indeed cried the mother and i should have known her anywhere for his sister was repeated by them all two or three times over for a moment catherine was surprised but mrs thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with mr james morland before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college of the name of thorpe and that he had spent the last week of the christmas vacation with his family near london the whole being explained many obliging things were said by the miss thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her of being considered as already friends through the friendship of their brothers etc which catherine heard with pleasure and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command and as the first proof of amity she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest miss thorpe and take a turn with her about the room catherine was delighted with this extension of her bath acquaintance and almost forgot mr tilney while she talked to miss thorpe friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love their conversation turned upon those subjects of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies such as dress balls flirtations and quizzes miss thorpe however being four years older than miss morland and at least four years better informed had a very decided advantage in discussing such points she could compare the balls of bath with those of tunbridge its fashions with the fashions of london could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd these powers received due admiration from catherine to whom they were entirely new and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity had not the easy gaiety of miss thorpe s manners and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her softened down every feeling of awe and left nothing but tender affection their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump room but required when they all quitted it together that miss thorpe should accompany miss morland to the very door of mr allen s house and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands after learning to their mutual relief that they should see each other across the theatre at night and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning catherine then ran directly upstairs and watched miss thorpe s progress down the street from the drawing room window admired the graceful spirit of her walk the fashionable air of her figure and dress and felt grateful as well she might for the chance which had procured her such a friend mrs thorpe was a widow and not a very rich one she was a good humoured well meaning woman and a very indulgent mother her eldest daughter had great personal beauty and the younger ones by pretending to be as handsome as their sister imitating her air and dressing in the same style did very well this brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from mrs thorpe herself of her past adventures and sufferings which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth and conversations which had passed twenty years before be minutely repeated chapter 5 catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening in returning the nods and smiles of miss thorpe though they certainly claimed much of her leisure as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for mr tilney in every box which her eye could reach but she looked in vain mr tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump room she hoped to be more fortunate the next day and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning she hardly felt a doubt of it for a fine sunday in bath empties every house of its inhabitants and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is as soon as divine service was over the thorpes and allens eagerly joined each other and after staying long enough in the pump room to discover that the crowd was insupportable and that there was not a genteel face to be seen which everybody discovers every sunday throughout the season they hastened away to the crescent to breathe the fresh air of better company here catherine and isabella arm in arm again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation they talked much and with much enjoyment but again was catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner he was nowhere to be met with every search for him was equally unsuccessful in morning lounges or evening assemblies neither at the upper nor lower rooms at dressed or undressed balls was he perceivable nor among the walkers the horsemen or the curricle drivers of the morning his name was not in the pump room book and curiosity could do no more he must be gone from bath yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short this sort of mysteriousness which is always so becoming in a hero threw a fresh grace in catherine s imagination around his person and manners and increased her anxiety to know more of him from the thorpes she could learn nothing for they had been only two days in bath before they met with mrs allen it was a subject however in which she often indulged with her fair friend from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear catherine and would therefore shortly return she liked him the better for being a clergyman for she must confess herself very partial to the profession and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it perhaps catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love or the duties of friendship to know when delicate raillery was properly called for or when a confidence should be forced mrs allen was now quite happy quite satisfied with bath she had found some acquaintance had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend and as the completion of good fortune had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself her daily expressions were no longer i wish we had some acquaintance in bath they were changed into how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families as her young charge and isabella themselves could be never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of mrs thorpe in what they called conversation but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion and not often any resemblance of subject for mrs thorpe talked chiefly of her children and mrs allen of her gowns the progress of the friendship between catherine and isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves they called each other by their christian name were always arm in arm when they walked pinned up each other s train for the dance and were not to be divided in the set and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt and shut themselves up to read novels together yes novels for i will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel writers of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances to the number of which they are themselves adding joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine who if she accidentally take up a novel is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust alas if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another from whom can she expect protection and regard i cannot approve of it let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans let us not desert one another we are an injured body although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world no species of composition has been so much decried from pride ignorance or fashion our foes are almost as many as our readers and while the abilities of the nine hundredth abridger of the history of england or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of milton pope and prior with a paper from the spectator and a chapter from sterne are eulogized by a thousand pens there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist and of slighting the performances which have only genius wit and taste to recommend them i am no novel reader i seldom look into novels do not imagine that _ i _ often read novels it is really very well for a novel such is the common cant and what are you reading miss oh it is only a novel replies the young lady while she lays down her book with affected indifference or momentary shame it is only cecilia or camilla or belinda or in short only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature the happiest delineation of its varieties the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language now had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the spectator instead of such a work how proudly would she have produced the book and told its name though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances unnatural characters and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living and their language too frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it chapter 6 the following conversation which took place between the two friends in the pump room one morning after an acquaintance of eight or nine days is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment and of the delicacy discretion originality of thought and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment they met by appointment and as isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend her first address naturally was my dearest creature what can have made you so late i have been waiting for you at least this age have you indeed i am very sorry for it but really i thought i was in very good time it is but just one i hope you have not been here long oh these ten ages at least i am sure i have been here this half hour but now let us go and sit down at the other end of the room and enjoy ourselves i have an hundred things to say to you in the first place i was so afraid it would rain this morning just as i wanted to set off it looked very showery and that would have thrown me into agonies do you know i saw the prettiest hat you can imagine in a shop window in milsom street just now very like yours only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green i quite longed for it but my dearest catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning have you gone on with udolpho yes i have been reading it ever since i woke and i am got to the black veil are you indeed how delightful oh i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world are not you wild to know oh yes quite what can it be but do not tell me i would not be told upon any account i know it must be a skeleton i am sure it is laurentina s skeleton oh i am delighted with the book i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world dear creature how much i am obliged to you and when you have finished udolpho we will read the italian together and i have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you have you indeed how glad i am what are they all i will read you their names directly here they are in my pocketbook castle of wolfenbach clermont mysterious warnings necromancer of the black forest midnight bell orphan of the rhine and horrid mysteries those will last us some time yes pretty well but are they all horrid are you sure they are all horrid yes quite sure for a particular friend of mine a miss andrews a sweet girl one of the sweetest creatures in the world has read every one of them i wish you knew miss andrews you would be delighted with her she is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive i think her as beautiful as an angel and i am so vexed with the men for not admiring her i scold them all amazingly about it scold them do you scold them for not admiring her yes that i do there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature my attachments are always excessively strong i told captain hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him unless he would allow miss andrews to be as beautiful as an angel the men think us incapable of real friendship you know and i am determined to show them the difference now if i were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you i should fire up in a moment but that is not at all likely for _ you _ are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men oh dear cried catherine colouring how can you say so i know you very well you have so much animation which is exactly what miss andrews wants for i must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you that just after we parted yesterday i saw a young man looking at you so earnestly i am sure he is in love with you catherine coloured and disclaimed again isabella laughed it is very true upon my honour but i see how it is you are indifferent to everybody s admiration except that of one gentleman who shall be nameless nay i cannot blame you speaking more seriously your feelings are easily understood where the heart is really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else everything is so insipid so uninteresting that does not relate to the beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never see him again not see him again my dearest creature do not talk of it i am sure you would be miserable if you thought so no indeed i should not i do not pretend to say that i was not very much pleased with him but while i have udolpho to read i feel as if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must be laurentina s skeleton behind it it is so odd to me that you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects to novels no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall in our way sir charles grandison that is an amazing horrid book is it not i remember miss andrews could not get through the first volume it is not like udolpho at all but yet i think it is very entertaining do you indeed you surprise me i thought it had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head to night i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you the men take notice of _ that _ sometimes you know but it does not signify if they do said catherine very innocently signify oh heavens i make it a rule never to mind what they say they are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit and make them keep their distance are they well i never observed _ that _ they always behave very well to me oh they give themselves such airs they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of so much importance by the by though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man do you like them best dark or fair i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown not fair and and not very dark very well catherine that is exactly he i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown skin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste is different i prefer light eyes and as to complexion do you know i like a sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description betray you what do you mean nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop the subject catherine in some amazement complied and after remaining a few moments silent was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world laurentina s skeleton when her friend prevented her by saying for heaven s sake let us move away from this end of the room do you know there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour they really put me quite out of countenance let us go and look at the arrivals they will hardly follow us there away they walked to the book and while isabella examined the names it was catherine s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men they are not coming this way are they i hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us pray let me know if they are coming i am determined i will not look up in a few moments catherine with unaffected pleasure assured her that she need not be longer uneasy as the gentlemen had just left the pump room and which way are they gone said isabella turning hastily round one was a very good looking young man they went towards the church yard well i am amazingly glad i have got rid of them and now what say you to going to edgar s buildings with me and looking at my new hat you said you should like to see it catherine readily agreed only she added perhaps we may overtake the two young men oh never mind that if we make haste we shall pass by them presently and i am dying to show you my hat but if we only wait a few minutes there will be no danger of our seeing them at all i shall not pay them any such compliment i assure you i have no notion of treating men with such respect _ that _ is the way to spoil them catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning and therefore to show the independence of miss thorpe and her resolution of humbling the sex they set off immediately as fast as they could walk in pursuit of the two young men chapter 7 half a minute conducted them through the pump yard to the archway opposite union passage but here they were stopped everybody acquainted with bath may remember the difficulties of crossing cheap street at this point it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature so unfortunately connected with the great london and oxford roads and the principal inn of the city that a day never passes in which parties of ladies however important their business whether in quest of pastry millinery or even as in the present case of young men are not detained on one side or other by carriages horsemen or carts this evil had been felt and lamented at least three times a day by isabella since her residence in bath and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more for at the very moment of coming opposite to union passage and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds and threading the gutters of that interesting alley they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself his companion and his horse oh these odious gigs said isabella looking up how i detest them but this detestation though so just was of short duration for she looked again and exclaimed delightful mr morland and my brother good heaven tis james was uttered at the same moment by catherine and on catching the young men s eyes the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches and the servant having now scampered up the gentlemen jumped out and the equipage was delivered to his care catherine by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected received her brother with the liveliest pleasure and he being of a very amiable disposition and sincerely attached to her gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction which he could have leisure to do while the bright eyes of miss thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice and to her his devoirs were speedily paid with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed catherine had she been more expert in the development of other people s feelings and less simply engrossed by her own that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself john thorpe who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses soon joined them and from him she directly received the amends which were her due for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of isabella on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow he was a stout young man of middling height who with a plain face and ungraceful form seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to be civil and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy he took out his watch how long do you think we have been running it from tetbury miss morland i do not know the distance her brother told her that it was twenty three miles _ three _ and twenty cried thorpe five and twenty if it is an inch morland remonstrated pleaded the authority of road books innkeepers and milestones but his friend disregarded them all he had a surer test of distance i know it must be five and twenty said he by the time we have been doing it it is now half after one we drove out of the inn yard at tetbury as the town clock struck eleven and i defy any man in england to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness that makes it exactly twenty five you have lost an hour said morland it was only ten o clock when we came from tetbury ten o clock it was eleven upon my soul i counted every stroke this brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses miss morland do but look at my horse did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life the servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving off such true blood three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles look at that creature and suppose it possible if you can he _ does _ look very hot to be sure hot he had not turned a hair till we came to walcot church but look at his forehand look at his loins only see how he moves that horse _ cannot _ go less than ten miles an hour tie his legs and he will get on what do you think of my gig miss morland a neat one is not it well hung town built i have not had it a month it was built for a christchurch man a friend of mine a very good sort of fellow he ran it a few weeks till i believe it was convenient to have done with it i happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind though i had pretty well determined on a curricle too but i chanced to meet him on magdalen bridge as he was driving into oxford last term ah thorpe said he do you happen to want such a little thing as this it is a capital one of the kind but i am cursed tired of it oh d said i i am your man what do you ask and how much do you think he did miss morland i am sure i cannot guess at all curricle hung you see seat trunk sword case splashing board lamps silver moulding all you see complete the iron work as good as new or better he asked fifty guineas i closed with him directly threw down the money and the carriage was mine and i am sure said catherine i know so little of such things that i cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear neither one nor t other i might have got it for less i dare say but i hate haggling and poor freeman wanted cash that was very good natured of you said catherine quite pleased oh d it when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend i hate to be pitiful an inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young ladies and on finding whither they were going it was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to edgar s buildings and pay their respects to mrs thorpe james and isabella led the way and so well satisfied was the latter with her lot so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother s friend and her friend s brother so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings that though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in milsom street she was so far from seeking to attract their notice that she looked back at them only three times john thorpe kept of course with catherine and after a few minutes silence renewed the conversation about his gig you will find however miss morland it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people for i might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day jackson of oriel bid me sixty at once morland was with me at the time yes said morland who overheard this but you forget that your horse was included my horse oh d it i would not sell my horse for a hundred are you fond of an open carriage miss morland yes very i have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one but i am particularly fond of it i am glad of it i will drive you out in mine every day thank you said catherine in some distress from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer i will drive you up lansdown hill to morrow thank you but will not your horse want rest rest he has only come three and twenty miles to day all nonsense nothing ruins horses so much as rest nothing knocks them up so soon no no i shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while i am here shall you indeed said catherine very seriously that will be forty miles a day forty aye fifty for what i care well i will drive you up lansdown to morrow mind i am engaged how delightful that will be cried isabella turning round my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third a third indeed no no i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about that would be a good joke faith morland must take care of you this brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two but catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result her companion s discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met and catherine after listening and agreeing as long as she could with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self assured man especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts it was have you ever read udolpho mr thorpe udolpho oh lord not i i never read novels i have something else to do catherine humbled and ashamed was going to apologize for her question but he prevented her by saying novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since tom jones except the monk i read that t other day but as for all the others they are the stupidest things in creation i think you must like udolpho if you were to read it it is so very interesting not i faith no if i read any it shall be mrs radcliffe s her novels are amusing enough they are worth reading some fun and nature in _ them _ udolpho was written by mrs radcliffe said catherine with some hesitation from the fear of mortifying him no sure was it aye i remember so it was i was thinking of that other stupid book written by that woman they make such a fuss about she who married the french emigrant i suppose you mean camilla yes that s the book such unnatural stuff an old man playing at see saw i took up the first volume once and looked it over but i soon found it would not do indeed i guessed what sort of stuff it must be before i saw it as soon as i heard she had married an emigrant i was sure i should never be able to get through it i have never read it you had no loss i assure you it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine there is nothing in the world in it but an old man s playing at see saw and learning latin upon my soul there is not this critique the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor catherine brought them to the door of mrs thorpe s lodgings and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son as they met mrs thorpe who had descried them from above in the passage ah mother how do you do said he giving her a hearty shake of the hand where did you get that quiz of a hat it makes you look like an old witch here is morland and i come to stay a few days with you so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near and this address seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother s heart for she received him with the most delighted and exulting affection on his two younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal tenderness for he asked each of them how they did and observed that they both looked very ugly these manners did not please catherine but he was james s friend and isabella s brother and her judgment was further bought off by isabella s assuring her when they withdrew to see the new hat that john thought her the most charming girl in the world and by john s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening had she been older or vainer such attacks might have done little but where youth and diffidence are united it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world and of being so very early engaged as a partner and the consequence was that when the two morlands after sitting an hour with the thorpes set off to walk together to mr allen s and james as the door was closed on them said well catherine how do you like my friend thorpe instead of answering as she probably would have done had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case i do not like him at all she directly replied i like him very much he seems very agreeable he is as good natured a fellow as ever lived a little of a rattle but that will recommend him to your sex i believe and how do you like the rest of the family very very much indeed isabella particularly i am very glad to hear you say so she is just the kind of young woman i could wish to see you attached to she has so much good sense and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable i always wanted you to know her and she seems very fond of you she said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be and the praise of such a girl as miss thorpe even you catherine taking her hand with affection may be proud of indeed i am she replied i love her exceedingly and am delighted to find that you like her too you hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there because i thought i should soon see you myself i hope you will be a great deal together while you are in bath she is a most amiable girl such a superior understanding how fond all the family are of her she is evidently the general favourite and how much she must be admired in such a place as this is not she yes very much indeed i fancy mr allen thinks her the prettiest girl in bath i dare say he does and i do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than mr allen i need not ask you whether you are happy here my dear catherine with such a companion and friend as isabella thorpe it would be impossible for you to be otherwise and the allens i am sure are very kind to you yes very kind i never was so happy before and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _ me _ james accepted this tribute of gratitude and qualified his conscience for accepting it too by saying with perfect sincerity indeed catherine i love you dearly inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters the situation of some the growth of the rest and other family matters now passed between them and continued with only one small digression on james s part in praise of miss thorpe till they reached pulteney street where he was welcomed with great kindness by mr and mrs allen invited by the former to dine with them and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet a pre engagement in edgar s buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other the time of the two parties uniting in the octagon room being correctly adjusted catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised restless and frightened imagination over the pages of udolpho lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner incapable of soothing mrs allen s fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity in being already engaged for the evening chapter 8 in spite of udolpho and the dressmaker however the party from pulteney street reached the upper rooms in very good time the thorpes and james morland were there only two minutes before them and isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste of admiring the set of her gown and envying the curl of her hair they followed their chaperons arm in arm into the ballroom whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection the dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated and james who had been engaged quite as long as his sister was very importunate with isabella to stand up but john was gone into the card room to speak to a friend and nothing she declared should induce her to join the set before her dear catherine could join it too i assure you said she i would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world for if i did we should certainly be separated the whole evening catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude and they continued as they were for three minutes longer when isabella who had been talking to james on the other side of her turned again to his sister and whispered my dear creature i am afraid i must leave you your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin i know you will not mind my going away and i dare say john will be back in a moment and then you may easily find me out catherine though a little disappointed had too much good nature to make any opposition and the others rising up isabella had only time to press her friend s hand and say good bye my dear love before they hurried off the younger miss thorpes being also dancing catherine was left to the mercy of mrs thorpe and mrs allen between whom she now remained she could not help being vexed at the non appearance of mr thorpe for she not only longed to be dancing but was likewise aware that as the real dignity of her situation could not be known she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner to be disgraced in the eye of the world to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity her actions all innocence and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine s life and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character catherine had fortitude too she suffered but no murmur passed her lips from this state of humiliation she was roused at the end of ten minutes to a pleasanter feeling by seeing not mr thorpe but mr tilney within three yards of the place where they sat he seemed to be moving that way but he did not see her and therefore the smile and the blush which his sudden reappearance raised in catherine passed away without sullying her heroic importance he looked as handsome and as lively as ever and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing looking young woman who leant on his arm and whom catherine immediately guessed to be his sister thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever by being married already but guided only by what was simple and probable it had never entered her head that mr tilney could be married he had not behaved he had not talked like the married men to whom she had been used he had never mentioned a wife and he had acknowledged a sister from these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister s now being by his side and therefore instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on mrs allen s bosom catherine sat erect in the perfect use of her senses and with cheeks only a little redder than usual mr tilney and his companion who continued though slowly to approach were immediately preceded by a lady an acquaintance of mrs thorpe and this lady stopping to speak to her they as belonging to her stopped likewise and catherine catching mr tilney s eye instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition she returned it with pleasure and then advancing still nearer he spoke both to her and mrs allen by whom he was very civilly acknowledged i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath he thanked her for her fears and said that he had quitted it for a week on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her well sir and i dare say you are not sorry to be back again for it is just the place for young people and indeed for everybody else too i tell mr allen when he talks of being sick of it that i am sure he should not complain for it is so very agreeable a place that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year i tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health and i hope madam that mr allen will be obliged to like the place from finding it of service to him thank you sir i have no doubt that he will a neighbour of ours dr skinner was here for his health last winter and came away quite stout that circumstance must give great encouragement yes sir and dr skinner and his family were here three months so i tell mr allen he must not be in a hurry to get away here they were interrupted by a request from mrs thorpe to mrs allen that she would move a little to accommodate mrs hughes and miss tilney with seats as they had agreed to join their party this was accordingly done mr tilney still continuing standing before them and after a few minutes consideration he asked catherine to dance with him this compliment delightful as it was produced severe mortification to the lady and in giving her denial she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it that had thorpe who joined her just afterwards been half a minute earlier he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute the very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left mr tilney of her dear isabella to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman she could see nothing they were in different sets she was separated from all her party and away from all her acquaintance one mortification succeeded another and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady from such a moralizing strain as this she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder and turning round perceived mrs hughes directly behind her attended by miss tilney and a gentleman i beg your pardon miss morland said she for this liberty but i cannot anyhow get to miss thorpe and mrs thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you mrs hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than catherine the young ladies were introduced to each other miss tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness miss morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation and mrs hughes satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge returned to her party miss tilney had a good figure a pretty face and a very agreeable countenance and her air though it had not all the decided pretension the resolute stylishness of miss thorpe s had more real elegance her manners showed good sense and good breeding they were neither shy nor affectedly open and she seemed capable of being young attractive and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence catherine interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to mr tilney was desirous of being acquainted with her and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say and had courage and leisure for saying it but the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance by informing themselves how well the other liked bath how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country whether she drew or played or sang and whether she was fond of riding on horseback the two dances were scarcely concluded before catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful isabella who in great spirits exclaimed at last i have got you my dearest creature i have been looking for you this hour what could induce you to come into this set when you knew i was in the other i have been quite wretched without you my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you i could not even see where you were so i told your brother all the time but he would not believe me do go and see for her mr morland said i but all in vain he would not stir an inch was not it so mr morland but you men are all so immoderately lazy i have been scolding him to such a degree my dear catherine you would be quite amazed you know i never stand upon ceremony with such people look at that young lady with the white beads round her head whispered catherine detaching her friend from james it is mr tilney s sister oh heavens you don t say so let me look at her this moment what a delightful girl i never saw anything half so beautiful but where is her all conquering brother is he in the room point him out to me this instant if he is i die to see him mr morland you are not to listen we are not talking about you but what is all this whispering about what is going on there now i knew how it would be you men have such restless curiosity talk of the curiosity of women indeed tis nothing but be satisfied for you are not to know anything at all of the matter and is that likely to satisfy me do you think well i declare i never knew anything like you what can it signify to you what we are talking of perhaps we are talking about you therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable in this commonplace chatter which lasted some time the original subject seemed entirely forgotten and though catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all isabella s impatient desire to see mr tilney when the orchestra struck up a fresh dance james would have led his fair partner away but she resisted i tell you mr morland she cried i would not do such a thing for all the world how can you be so teasing only conceive my dear catherine what your brother wants me to do he wants me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules it would make us the talk of the place if we were not to change partners upon my honour said james in these public assemblies it is as often done as not nonsense how can you say so but when you men have a point to carry you never stick at anything my sweet catherine do support me persuade your brother how impossible it is tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing now would not it no not at all but if you think it wrong you had much better change there cried isabella you hear what your sister says and yet you will not mind her well remember that it is not my fault if we set all the old ladies in bath in a bustle come along my dearest catherine for heaven s sake and stand by me and off they went to regain their former place john thorpe in the meanwhile had walked away and catherine ever willing to give mr tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once made her way to mrs allen and mrs thorpe as fast as she could in the hope of finding him still with them a hope which when it proved to be fruitless she felt to have been highly unreasonable well my dear said mrs thorpe impatient for praise of her son i hope you have had an agreeable partner very agreeable madam i am glad of it john has charming spirits has not he did you meet mr tilney my dear said mrs allen no where is he he was with us just now and said he was so tired of lounging about that he was resolved to go and dance so i thought perhaps he would ask you if he met with you where can he be said catherine looking round but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance ah he has got a partner i wish he had asked _ you _ said mrs allen and after a short silence she added he is a very agreeable young man indeed he is mrs allen said mrs thorpe smiling complacently i must say it though i _ am _ his mother that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world this inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many but it did not puzzle mrs allen for after only a moment s consideration she said in a whisper to catherine i dare say she thought i was speaking of her son catherine was disappointed and vexed she seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply when john thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said well miss morland i suppose you and i are to stand up and jig it together again oh no i am much obliged to you our two dances are over and besides i am tired and do not mean to dance any more do not you then let us walk about and quiz people come along with me and i will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room my two younger sisters and their partners i have been laughing at them this half hour again catherine excused herself and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself the rest of the evening she found very dull mr tilney was drawn away from their party at tea to attend that of his partner miss tilney though belonging to it did not sit near her and james and isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile one squeeze and one dearest catherine chapter 9 the progress of catherine s unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows it appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her while she remained in the rooms which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home this on arriving in pulteney street took the direction of extraordinary hunger and when that was appeased changed into an earnest longing to be in bed such was the extreme point of her distress for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours and from which she awoke perfectly revived in excellent spirits with fresh hopes and fresh schemes the first wish of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with miss tilney and almost her first resolution to seek her for that purpose in the pump room at noon in the pump room one so newly arrived in bath must be met with and that building she had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence and the completion of female intimacy so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited confidence that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls her plan for the morning thus settled she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of mrs allen whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such that as she never talked a great deal so she could never be entirely silent and therefore while she sat at her work if she lost her needle or broke her thread if she heard a carriage in the street or saw a speck upon her gown she must observe it aloud whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not at about half past twelve a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window and scarcely had she time to inform catherine of there being two open carriages at the door in the first only a servant her brother driving miss thorpe in the second before john thorpe came running upstairs calling out well miss morland here i am have you been waiting long we could not come before the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street how do you do mrs allen a famous ball last night was not it come miss morland be quick for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off they want to get their tumble over what do you mean said catherine where are you all going to going to why you have not forgot our engagement did not we agree together to take a drive this morning what a head you have we are going up claverton down something was said about it i remember said catherine looking at mrs allen for her opinion but really i did not expect you not expect me that s a good one and what a dust you would have made if i had not come catherine s silent appeal to her friend meanwhile was entirely thrown away for mrs allen not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else and catherine whose desire of seeing miss tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with mr thorpe as isabella was going at the same time with james was therefore obliged to speak plainer well ma am what do you say to it can you spare me for an hour or two shall i go do just as you please my dear replied mrs allen with the most placid indifference catherine took the advice and ran off to get ready in a very few minutes she reappeared having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise after thorpe had procured mrs allen s admiration of his gig and then receiving her friend s parting good wishes they both hurried downstairs my dearest creature cried isabella to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage you have been at least three hours getting ready i was afraid you were ill what a delightful ball we had last night i have a thousand things to say to you but make haste and get in for i long to be off catherine followed her orders and turned away but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to james what a sweet girl she is i quite dote on her you will not be frightened miss morland said thorpe as he handed her in if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off he will most likely give a plunge or two and perhaps take the rest for a minute but he will soon know his master he is full of spirits playful as can be but there is no vice in him catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one but it was too late to retreat and she was too young to own herself frightened so resigning herself to her fate and trusting to the animal s boasted knowledge of its owner she sat peaceably down and saw thorpe sit down by her everything being then arranged the servant who stood at the horse s head was bid in an important voice to let him go and off they went in the quietest manner imaginable without a plunge or a caper or anything like one catherine delighted at so happy an escape spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip catherine though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity and considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour by no means alarmingly fast gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind in a fine mild day of february with the consciousness of safety a silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue it was broken by thorpe s saying very abruptly old allen is as rich as a jew is not he catherine did not understand him and he repeated his question adding in explanation old allen the man you are with oh mr allen you mean yes i believe he is very rich and no children at all no not any a famous thing for his next heirs he is _ your _ godfather is not he my godfather no but you are always very much with them yes very much aye that is what i meant he seems a good kind of old fellow enough and has lived very well in his time i dare say he is not gouty for nothing does he drink his bottle a day now his bottle a day no why should you think of such a thing he is a very temperate man and you could not fancy him in liquor last night lord help you you women are always thinking of men s being in liquor why you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle i am sure of _ this _ that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now it would be a famous good thing for us all i cannot believe it oh lord it would be the saving of thousands there is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be our foggy climate wants help and yet i have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in oxford oxford there is no drinking at oxford now i assure you nobody drinks there you would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost now for instance it was reckoned a remarkable thing at the last party in my rooms that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head it was looked upon as something out of the common way _ mine _ is famous good stuff to be sure you would not often meet with anything like it in oxford and that may account for it but this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there yes it does give a notion said catherine warmly and that is that you all drink a great deal more wine than i thought you did however i am sure james does not drink so much this declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply of which no part was very distinct except the frequent exclamations amounting almost to oaths which adorned it and catherine was left when it ended with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in oxford and the same happy conviction of her brother s comparative sobriety thorpe s ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage and she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse moved along and the ease which his paces as well as the excellence of the springs gave the motion of the carriage she followed him in all his admiration as well as she could to go before or beyond him was impossible his knowledge and her ignorance of the subject his rapidity of expression and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power she could strike out nothing new in commendation but she readily echoed whatever he chose to assert and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most complete of its kind in england his carriage the neatest his horse the best goer and himself the best coachman you do not really think mr thorpe said catherine venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided and to offer some little variation on the subject that james s gig will break down break down oh lord did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life there is not a sound piece of iron about it the wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body upon my soul you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch it is the most devilish little rickety business i ever beheld thank god we have got a better i would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds good heavens cried catherine quite frightened then pray let us turn back they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on do let us turn back mr thorpe stop and speak to my brother and tell him how very unsafe it is unsafe oh lord what is there in that they will only get a roll if it does break down and there is plenty of dirt it will be excellent falling oh curse it the carriage is safe enough if a man knows how to drive it a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out lord bless you i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to york and back again without losing a nail catherine listened with astonishment she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead her own family were plain matter of fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind her father at the utmost being contented with a pun and her mother with a proverb they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next she reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity and was more than once on the point of requesting from mr thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject but she checked herself because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous and joining to this the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve them she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe and therefore would alarm herself no longer by him the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten and all the rest of his conversation or rather talk began and ended with himself and his own concerns he told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums of racing matches in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner of shooting parties in which he had killed more birds though without having one good shot than all his companions together and described to her some famous day s sport with the fox hounds in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman and in which the boldness of his riding though it had never endangered his own life for a moment had been constantly leading others into difficulties which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many little as catherine was in the habit of judging for herself and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be she could not entirely repress a doubt while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit of his being altogether completely agreeable it was a bold surmise for he was isabella s brother and she had been assured by james that his manners would recommend him to all her sex but in spite of this the extreme weariness of his company which crept over her before they had been out an hour and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in pulteney street again induced her in some small degree to resist such high authority and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure when they arrived at mrs allen s door the astonishment of isabella was hardly to be expressed on finding that it was too late in the day for them to attend her friend into the house past three o clock it was inconceivable incredible impossible and she would neither believe her own watch nor her brother s nor the servant s she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality till morland produced his watch and ascertained the fact to have doubted a moment longer _ then _ would have been equally inconceivable incredible and impossible and she could only protest over and over again that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before as catherine was called on to confirm catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please isabella but the latter was spared the misery of her friend s dissenting voice by not waiting for her answer her own feelings entirely engrossed her her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go directly home it was ages since she had had a moment s conversation with her dearest catherine and though she had such thousands of things to say to her it appeared as if they were never to be together again so with smiles of most exquisite misery and the laughing eye of utter despondency she bade her friend adieu and went on catherine found mrs allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning and was immediately greeted with well my dear here you are a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute and i hope you have had a pleasant airing yes ma am i thank you we could not have had a nicer day so mrs thorpe said she was vastly pleased at your all going you have seen mrs thorpe then yes i went to the pump room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together she says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning it is so uncommonly scarce did you see anybody else of our acquaintance yes we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs hughes and mr and miss tilney walking with her did you indeed and did they speak to you yes we walked along the crescent together for half an hour they seem very agreeable people miss tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely mrs hughes talked to me a great deal about the family and what did she tell you of them oh a vast deal indeed she hardly talked of anything else did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from yes she did but i cannot recollect now but they are very good kind of people and very rich mrs tilney was a miss drummond and she and mrs hughes were schoolfellows and miss drummond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and five hundred to buy wedding clothes mrs hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse and are mr and mrs tilney in bath yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead at least the mother is yes i am sure mrs tilney is dead because mrs hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr drummond gave his daughter on her wedding day and that miss tilney has got now for they were put by for her when her mother died and is mr tilney my partner the only son i cannot be quite positive about that my dear i have some idea he is but however he is a very fine young man mrs hughes says and likely to do very well catherine inquired no further she had heard enough to feel that mrs allen had no real intelligence to give and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister could she have foreseen such a circumstance nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others and as it was she could only lament her ill luck and think over what she had lost till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that john thorpe himself was quite disagreeable chapter 10 the allens thorpes and morlands all met in the evening at the theatre and as catherine and isabella sat together there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them oh heavens my beloved catherine have i got you at last was her address on catherine s entering the box and sitting by her now mr morland for he was close to her on the other side i shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening so i charge you not to expect it my sweetest catherine how have you been this long age but i need not ask you for you look delightfully you really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever you mischievous creature do you want to attract everybody i assure you my brother is quite in love with you already and as for mr tilney but _ that _ is a settled thing even _ your _ modesty cannot doubt his attachment now his coming back to bath makes it too plain oh what would not i give to see him i really am quite wild with impatience my mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world she saw him this morning you know you must introduce him to me is he in the house now look about for heaven s sake i assure you i can hardly exist till i see him no said catherine he is not here i cannot see him anywhere oh horrid am i never to be acquainted with him how do you like my gown i think it does not look amiss the sleeves were entirely my own thought do you know i get so immoderately sick of bath your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for millions we soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place really our opinions were so exactly the same it was quite ridiculous there was not a single point in which we differed i would not have had you by for the world you are such a sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it no indeed i should not oh yes you would indeed i know you better than you know yourself you would have told us that we seemed born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception my cheeks would have been as red as your roses i would not have had you by for the world indeed you do me injustice i would not have made so improper a remark upon any account and besides i am sure it would never have entered my head isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to james catherine s resolution of endeavouring to meet miss tilney again continued in full force the next morning and till the usual moment of going to the pump room she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention but nothing of that kind occurred no visitors appeared to delay them and they all three set off in good time for the pump room where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place mr allen after drinking his glass of water joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their newspapers and the ladies walked about together noticing every new face and almost every new bonnet in the room the female part of the thorpe family attended by james morland appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour and catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend james who was now in constant attendance maintained a similar position and separating themselves from the rest of their party they walked in that manner for some time till catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which confining her entirely to her friend and brother gave her very little share in the notice of either they were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute but their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices and their vivacity attended with so much laughter that though catherine s supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other she was never able to give any from not having heard a word of the subject at length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend by the avowed necessity of speaking to miss tilney whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with mrs hughes and whom she instantly joined with a firmer determination to be acquainted than she might have had courage to command had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before miss tilney met her with great civility returned her advances with equal goodwill and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room and though in all probability not an observation was made nor an expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of times before under that roof in every bath season yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity and truth and without personal conceit might be something uncommon how well your brother dances was an artless exclamation of catherine s towards the close of their conversation which at once surprised and amused her companion henry she replied with a smile yes he does dance very well he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr thorpe miss tilney could only bow you cannot think added catherine after a moment s silence how surprised i was to see him again i felt so sure of his being quite gone away when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he was in bath but for a couple of days he came only to engage lodgings for us _ that _ never occurred to me and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone was not the young lady he danced with on monday a miss smith yes an acquaintance of mrs hughes i dare say she was very glad to dance do you think her pretty not very he never comes to the pump room i suppose yes sometimes but he has rid out this morning with my father mrs hughes now joined them and asked miss tilney if she was ready to go i hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon said catherine shall you be at the cotillion ball to morrow perhaps we yes i think we certainly shall i am glad of it for we shall all be there this civility was duly returned and they parted on miss tilney s side with some knowledge of her new acquaintance s feelings and on catherine s without the smallest consciousness of having explained them she went home very happy the morning had answered all her hopes and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation the future good what gown and what head dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern she cannot be justified in it dress is at all times a frivolous distinction and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim catherine knew all this very well her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the christmas before and yet she lay awake ten minutes on wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening this would have been an error in judgment great though not uncommon from which one of the other sex rather than her own a brother rather than a great aunt might have warned her for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown it would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies could they be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted the sprigged the mull or the jackonet woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone no man will admire her the more no woman will like her the better for it neatness and fashion are enough for the former and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter but not one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of catherine she entered the rooms on thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the monday before she had then been exulting in her engagement to thorpe and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight lest he should engage her again for though she could not dared not expect that mr tilney should ask her a third time to dance her wishes hopes and plans all centred in nothing less every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment for every young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation all have been or at least all have believed themselves to be in danger from the pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid and all have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please as soon as they were joined by the thorpes catherine s agony began she fidgeted about if john thorpe came towards her hid herself as much as possible from his view and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him the cotillions were over the country dancing beginning and she saw nothing of the tilneys do not be frightened my dear catherine whispered isabella but i am really going to dance with your brother again i declare positively it is quite shocking i tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself but you and john must keep us in countenance make haste my dear creature and come to us john is just walked off but he will be back in a moment catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer the others walked away john thorpe was still in view and she gave herself up for lost that she might not appear however to observe or expect him she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan and a self condemnation for her folly in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the tilneys in any reasonable time had just passed through her mind when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance by mr tilney himself with what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set may be easily imagined to escape and as she believed so narrowly escape john thorpe and to be asked so immediately on his joining her asked by mr tilney as if he had sought her on purpose it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place however when her attention was claimed by john thorpe who stood behind her heyday miss morland said he what is the meaning of this i thought you and i were to dance together i wonder you should think so for you never asked me that is a good one by jove i asked you as soon as i came into the room and i was just going to ask you again but when i turned round you were gone this is a cursed shabby trick i only came for the sake of dancing with _ you _ and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday yes i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famously oh no they will never think of _ me _ after such a description as that by heavens if they do not i will kick them out of the room for blockheads what chap have you there catherine satisfied his curiosity tilney he repeated hum i do not know him a good figure of a man well put together does he want a horse here is a friend of mine sam fletcher has got one to sell that would suit anybody a famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the field i would give any money for a real good hunter i have three now the best that ever were backed i would not take eight hundred guineas for them fletcher and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season it is so d uncomfortable living at an inn this was the last sentence by which he could weary catherine s attention for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies her partner now drew near and said that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours but they are such very different things that you think they cannot be compared together to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water _ that _ i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison no indeed i never thought of that then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with and is that to be my only security alas alas nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not _ want _ to talk to anybody now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before yes quite more so indeed more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond _ that _ it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there you are not fond of the country yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country do i do you not i do not believe there is much difference here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen mr tilney was very much amused only go and call on mrs allen he repeated what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i _ do _ like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them here their conversation closed the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention soon after their reaching the bottom of the set catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers on immediately behind her partner he was a very handsome man of a commanding aspect past the bloom but not past the vigour of life and with his eye still directed towards her she saw him presently address mr tilney in a familiar whisper confused by his notice and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance she turned away her head but while she did so the gentleman retreated and her partner coming nearer said i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father catherine s answer was only oh but it was an oh expressing everything needful attention to his words and perfect reliance on their truth with real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the general as he moved through the crowd and how handsome a family they are was her secret remark in chatting with miss tilney before the evening concluded a new source of felicity arose to her she had never taken a country walk since her arrival in bath miss tilney to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk some morning or other i shall like it she cried beyond anything in the world and do not let us put it off let us go to morrow this was readily agreed to with only a proviso of miss tilney s that it did not rain which catherine was sure it would not at twelve o clock they were to call for her in pulteney street and remember twelve o clock was her parting speech to her new friend of her other her older her more established friend isabella of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight s experience she scarcely saw anything during the evening yet though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness she cheerfully submitted to the wish of mr allen which took them rather early away and her spirits danced within her as she danced in her chair all the way home chapter 11 the morrow brought a very sober looking morning the sun making only a few efforts to appear and catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes a bright morning so early in the year she allowed would generally turn to rain but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced she applied to mr allen for confirmation of her hopes but mr allen not having his own skies and barometer about him declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine she applied to mrs allen and mrs allen s opinion was more positive she had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day if the clouds would only go off and the sun keep out at about eleven o clock however a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught catherine s watchful eye and oh dear i do believe it will be wet broke from her in a most desponding tone i thought how it would be said mrs allen no walk for me to day sighed catherine but perhaps it may come to nothing or it may hold up before twelve perhaps it may but then my dear it will be so dirty oh that will not signify i never mind dirt no replied her friend very placidly i know you never mind dirt after a short pause it comes on faster and faster said catherine as she stood watching at a window so it does indeed if it keeps raining the streets will be very wet there are four umbrellas up already how i hate the sight of an umbrella they are disagreeable things to carry i would much rather take a chair at any time it was such a nice looking morning i felt so convinced it would be dry anybody would have thought so indeed there will be very few people in the pump room if it rains all the morning i hope mr allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat i wonder he should dislike it it must be so comfortable the rain continued fast though not heavy catherine went every five minutes to the clock threatening on each return that if it still kept on raining another five minutes she would give up the matter as hopeless the clock struck twelve and it still rained you will not be able to go my dear i do not quite despair yet i shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve this is just the time of day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter there it is twenty minutes after twelve and now i _ shall _ give it up entirely oh that we had such weather here as they had at udolpho or at least in tuscany and the south of france the night that poor st aubin died such beautiful weather at half past twelve when catherine s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment the sky began voluntarily to clear a gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise she looked round the clouds were parting and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed and justified the opinion of mrs allen who had always thought it would clear up but whether catherine might still expect her friends whether there had not been too much rain for miss tilney to venture must yet be a question it was too dirty for mrs allen to accompany her husband to the pump room he accordingly set off by himself and catherine had barely watched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages containing the same three people that had surprised her so much a few mornings back isabella my brother and mr thorpe i declare they are coming for me perhaps but i shall not go i cannot go indeed for you know miss tilney may still call mrs allen agreed to it john thorpe was soon with them and his voice was with them yet sooner for on the stairs he was calling out to miss morland to be quick make haste make haste as he threw open the door put on your hat this moment there is no time to be lost we are going to bristol how d ye do mrs allen to bristol is not that a great way off but however i cannot go with you to day because i am engaged i expect some friends every moment this was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all mrs allen was called on to second him and the two others walked in to give their assistance my sweetest catherine is not this delightful we shall have a most heavenly drive you are to thank your brother and me for the scheme it darted into our heads at breakfast time i verily believe at the same instant and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain but it does not signify the nights are moonlight and we shall do delightfully oh i am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet so much better than going to the lower rooms we shall drive directly to clifton and dine there and as soon as dinner is over if there is time for it go on to kingsweston i doubt our being able to do so much said morland you croaking fellow cried thorpe we shall be able to do ten times more kingsweston aye and blaize castle too and anything else we can hear of but here is your sister says she will not go blaize castle cried catherine what is that the finest place in england worth going fifty miles at any time to see what is it really a castle an old castle the oldest in the kingdom but is it like what one reads of exactly the very same but now really are there towers and long galleries by dozens then i should like to see it but i cannot i cannot go not go my beloved creature what do you mean i cannot go because looking down as she spoke fearful of isabella s smile i expect miss tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk they promised to come at twelve only it rained but now as it is so fine i dare say they will be here soon not they indeed cried thorpe for as we turned into broad street i saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts i do not know indeed yes i know he does i saw him you are talking of the man you danced with last night are not you yes well i saw him at that moment turn up the lansdown road driving a smart looking girl did you indeed did upon my soul knew him again directly and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too it is very odd but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life walk you could no more walk than you could fly it has not been so dirty the whole winter it is ankle deep everywhere isabella corroborated it my dearest catherine you cannot form an idea of the dirt come you must go you cannot refuse going now i should like to see the castle but may we go all over it may we go up every staircase and into every suite of rooms yes yes every hole and corner but then if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer and call by and by make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks then i will shall i go mrs allen just as you please my dear mrs allen you must persuade her to go was the general cry mrs allen was not inattentive to it well my dear said she suppose you go and in two minutes they were off catherine s feelings as she got into the carriage were in a very unsettled state divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure and the hope of soon enjoying another almost its equal in degree however unlike in kind she could not think the tilneys had acted quite well by her in so readily giving up their engagement without sending her any message of excuse it was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk and in spite of what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour she could not from her own observation help thinking that they might have gone with very little inconvenience to feel herself slighted by them was very painful on the other hand the delight of exploring an edifice like udolpho as her fancy represented blaize castle to be was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for almost anything they passed briskly down pulteney street and through laura place without the exchange of many words thorpe talked to his horse and she meditated by turns on broken promises and broken arches phaetons and false hangings tilneys and trap doors as they entered argyle buildings however she was roused by this address from her companion who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by who where on the right hand pavement she must be almost out of sight now catherine looked round and saw miss tilney leaning on her brother s arm walking slowly down the street she saw them both looking back at her stop stop mr thorpe she impatiently cried it is miss tilney it is indeed how could you tell me they were gone stop stop i will get out this moment and go to them but to what purpose did she speak thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot the tilneys who had soon ceased to look after her were in a moment out of sight round the corner of laura place and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace still however and during the length of another street she entreated him to stop pray pray stop mr thorpe i cannot go on i will not go on i must go back to miss tilney but mr thorpe only laughed smacked his whip encouraged his horse made odd noises and drove on and catherine angry and vexed as she was having no power of getting away was obliged to give up the point and submit her reproaches however were not spared how could you deceive me so mr thorpe how could you say that you saw them driving up the lansdown road i would not have had it happen so for the world they must think it so strange so rude of me to go by them too without saying a word you do not know how vexed i am i shall have no pleasure at clifton nor in anything else i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now and walk back to them how could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton thorpe defended himself very stoutly declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life and would hardly give up the point of its having been tilney himself their drive even when this subject was over was not likely to be very agreeable catherine s complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing she listened reluctantly and her replies were short blaize castle remained her only comfort towards _ that _ she still looked at intervals with pleasure though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk and especially rather than be thought ill of by the tilneys she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its walls could supply the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture though now for many years deserted the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow winding vaults by a low grated door or even of having their lamp their only lamp extinguished by a sudden gust of wind and of being left in total darkness in the meanwhile they proceeded on their journey without any mischance and were within view of the town of keynsham when a halloo from morland who was behind them made his friend pull up to know what was the matter the others then came close enough for conversation and morland said we had better go back thorpe it is too late to go on to day your sister thinks so as well as i we have been exactly an hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven miles and i suppose we have at least eight more to go it will never do we set out a great deal too late we had much better put it off till another day and turn round it is all one to me replied thorpe rather angrily and instantly turning his horse they were on their way back to bath if your brother had not got such a d beast to drive said he soon afterwards we might have done it very well my horse would have trotted to clifton within the hour if left to himself and i have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken winded jade s pace morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own no he is not said catherine warmly for i am sure he could not afford it and why cannot he afford it because he has not money enough and whose fault is that nobody s that i know of thorpe then said something in the loud incoherent way to which he had often recourse about its being a d thing to be miserly and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things he did not know who could which catherine did not even endeavour to understand disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for her first disappointment she was less and less disposed either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so and they returned to pulteney street without her speaking twenty words as she entered the house the footman told her that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off that when he told them she was gone out with mr thorpe the lady had asked whether any message had been left for her and on his saying no had felt for a card but said she had none about her and went away pondering over these heart rending tidings catherine walked slowly upstairs at the head of them she was met by mr allen who on hearing the reason of their speedy return said i am glad your brother had so much sense i am glad you are come back it was a strange wild scheme they all spent the evening together at thorpe s catherine was disturbed and out of spirits but isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce in the fate of which she shared by private partnership with morland a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at clifton her satisfaction too in not being at the lower rooms was spoken more than once how i pity the poor creatures that are going there how glad i am that i am not amongst them i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not they have not begun dancing yet i would not be there for all the world it is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself i dare say it will not be a very good ball i know the mitchells will not be there i am sure i pity everybody that is but i dare say mr morland you long to be at it do not you i am sure you do well pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you i dare say we could do very well without you but you men think yourselves of such consequence catherine could almost have accused isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards herself and her sorrows so very little did they appear to dwell on her mind and so very inadequate was the comfort she offered do not be so dull my dearest creature she whispered you will quite break my heart it was amazingly shocking to be sure but the tilneys were entirely to blame why were not they more punctual it was dirty indeed but what did that signify i am sure john and i should not have minded it i never mind going through anything where a friend is concerned that is my disposition and john is just the same he has amazing strong feelings good heavens what a delightful hand you have got kings i vow i never was so happy in my life i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself and now i may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch which is the true heroine s portion to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears and lucky may she think herself if she get another good night s rest in the course of the next three months chapter 12 mrs allen said catherine the next morning will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney to day i shall not be easy till i have explained everything go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white catherine cheerfully complied and being properly equipped was more impatient than ever to be at the pump room that she might inform herself of general tilney s lodgings for though she believed they were in milsom street she was not certain of the house and mrs allen s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful to milsom street she was directed and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven tripping lightly through the church yard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see her beloved isabella and her dear family who she had reason to believe were in a shop hard by she reached the house without any impediment looked at the number knocked at the door and inquired for miss tilney the man believed miss tilney to be at home but was not quite certain would she be pleased to send up her name she gave her card in a few minutes the servant returned and with a look which did not quite confirm his words said he had been mistaken for that miss tilney was walked out catherine with a blush of mortification left the house she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney _ was _ at home and too much offended to admit her and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at the drawing room windows in expectation of seeing her there but no one appeared at them at the bottom of the street however she looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she saw miss tilney herself she was followed by a gentleman whom catherine believed to be her father and they turned up towards edgar s buildings catherine in deep mortification proceeded on her way she could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility but she checked the resentful sensation she remembered her own ignorance she knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable dejected and humbled she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night but it must be confessed that they were not of long continuance for she soon recollected in the first place that she was without any excuse for staying at home and in the second that it was a play she wanted very much to see to the theatre accordingly they all went no tilneys appeared to plague or please her she feared that amongst the many perfections of the family a fondness for plays was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the london stage which she knew on isabella s authority rendered everything else of the kind quite horrid she was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure the comedy so well suspended her care that no one observing her during the first four acts would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her on the beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mr henry tilney and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch henry tilney without being once able to catch his eye no longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes at length however he did look towards her and he bowed but such a bow no smile no continued observance attended it his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction catherine was restlessly miserable she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation instead of proudly resolving in conscious innocence to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct or at least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause the play concluded the curtain fell henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat but his father remained and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box she was right in a few minutes he appeared and making his way through the then thinning rows spoke with like calm politeness to mrs allen and her friend not with such calmness was he answered by the latter oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen my dear you tumble my gown was mrs allen s reply her assurance however standing sole as it did was not thrown away it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration henry tilney at least was not with a yet sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sister s concern regret and dependence on catherine s honour oh do not say miss tilney was not angry cried catherine because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible catherine s mind was greatly eased by this information yet a something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly artless in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman but mr tilney why were _ you _ less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should _ you _ be so ready to take offence me i take offence nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry i angry i could have no right well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play he remained with them some time and was only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away before they parted however it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box she was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in the world while talking to each other she had observed with some surprise that john thorpe who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together was engaged in conversation with general tilney and she felt something more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse what could they have to say of her she feared general tilney did not like her appearance she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes how came mr thorpe to know your father was her anxious inquiry as she pointed them out to her companion he knew nothing about it but his father like every military man had a very large acquaintance when the entertainment was over thorpe came to assist them in getting out catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry and while they waited in the lobby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue by asking in a consequential manner whether she had seen him talking with general tilney he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great regard for him i assure you a gentleman like good sort of fellow as ever lived but how came you to know him know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again to day the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i _ did _ beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew i should like to dine with him i dare say he gives famous dinners but what do you think we have been talking of you yes by heavens and the general thinks you the finest girl in bath oh nonsense how can you say so and what do you think i said lowering his voice well done general said i i am quite of your mind here catherine who was much less gratified by his admiration than by general tilney s was not sorry to be called away by mr allen thorpe however would see her to her chair and till she entered it continued the same kind of delicate flattery in spite of her entreating him to have done that general tilney instead of disliking should admire her was very delightful and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet the evening had done more much more for her than could have been expected chapter 13 monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and saturday have now passed in review before the reader the events of each day its hopes and fears mortifications and pleasures have been separately stated and the pangs of sunday only now remain to be described and close the week the clifton scheme had been deferred not relinquished and on the afternoon s crescent of this day it was brought forward again in a private consultation between isabella and james the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her it was agreed that provided the weather were fair the party should take place on the following morning and they were to set off very early in order to be at home in good time the affair thus determined and thorpe s approbation secured catherine only remained to be apprised of it she had left them for a few minutes to speak to miss tilney in that interval the plan was completed and as soon as she came again her agreement was demanded but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by isabella catherine looked grave was very sorry but could not go the engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her to accompany them now she had that moment settled with miss tilney to take their proposed walk to morrow it was quite determined and she would not upon any account retract but that she _ must _ and _ should _ retract was instantly the eager cry of both the thorpes they must go to clifton to morrow they would not go without her it would be nothing to put off a mere walk for one day longer and they would not hear of a refusal catherine was distressed but not subdued do not urge me isabella i am engaged to miss tilney i cannot go this availed nothing the same arguments assailed her again she must go she should go and they would not hear of a refusal it would be so easy to tell miss tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement and must only beg to put off the walk till tuesday no it would not be easy i could not do it there has been no prior engagement but isabella became only more and more urgent calling on her in the most affectionate manner addressing her by the most endearing names she was sure her dearest sweetest catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly she knew her beloved catherine to have so feeling a heart so sweet a temper to be so easily persuaded by those she loved but all in vain catherine felt herself to be in the right and though pained by such tender such flattering supplication could not allow it to influence her isabella then tried another method she reproached her with having more affection for miss tilney though she had known her so little a while than for her best and oldest friends with being grown cold and indifferent in short towards herself i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted for strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections are placed it is not in the power of anything to change them but i believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s i am sure they are too strong for my own peace and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick i own these tilneys seem to swallow up everything else catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish regardless of everything but her own gratification these painful ideas crossed her mind though she said nothing isabella in the meanwhile had applied her handkerchief to her eyes and morland miserable at such a sight could not help saying nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse this was the first time of her brother s openly siding against her and anxious to avoid his displeasure she proposed a compromise if they would only put off their scheme till tuesday which they might easily do as it depended only on themselves she could go with them and everybody might then be satisfied but no no no was the immediate answer that could not be for thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on tuesday catherine was sorry but could do no more and a short silence ensued which was broken by isabella who in a voice of cold resentment said very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing catherine you must go said james but why cannot mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters i dare say either of them would like to go thank ye cried thorpe but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you that is a compliment which gives me no pleasure but her words were lost on thorpe who had turned abruptly away the three others still continued together walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor catherine sometimes not a word was said sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches and her arm was still linked within isabella s though their hearts were at war at one moment she was softened at another irritated always distressed but always steady i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine said james you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters i hope i am not less so now she replied very feelingly but indeed i cannot go if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right i suspect said isabella in a low voice there is no great struggle catherine s heart swelled she drew away her arm and isabella made no opposition thus passed a long ten minutes till they were again joined by thorpe who coming to them with a gayer look said well i have settled the matter and now we may all go to morrow with a safe conscience i have been to miss tilney and made your excuses you have not cried catherine i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us to morrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey isabella s countenance was once more all smiles and good humour and james too looked happy again a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party this will not do said catherine i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right isabella however caught hold of one hand thorpe of the other and remonstrances poured in from all three even james was quite angry when everything was settled when miss tilney herself said that tuesday would suit her as well it was quite ridiculous quite absurd to make any further objection i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the tilneys they were turning the corner into brock street when he had overtaken them and were at home by this time then i will go after them said catherine wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it and with these words she broke away and hurried off thorpe would have darted after her but morland withheld him let her go let her go if she will go she is as obstinate as thorpe never finished the simile for it could hardly have been a proper one away walked catherine in great agitation as fast as the crowd would permit her fearful of being pursued yet determined to persevere as she walked she reflected on what had passed it was painful to her to disappoint and displease them particularly to displease her brother but she could not repent her resistance setting her own inclination apart to have failed a second time in her engagement to miss tilney to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before and on a false pretence too must have been wrong she had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone she had not consulted merely her own gratification _ that _ might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself by seeing blaize castle no she had attended to what was due to others and to her own character in their opinion her conviction of being right however was not enough to restore her composure till she had spoken to miss tilney she could not be at ease and quickening her pace when she got clear of the crescent she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of milsom street so rapid had been her movements that in spite of the tilneys advantage in the outset they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them and the servant still remaining at the open door she used only the ceremony of saying that she must speak with miss tilney that moment and hurrying by him proceeded upstairs then opening the first door before her which happened to be the right she immediately found herself in the drawing room with general tilney his son and daughter her explanation defective only in being from her irritation of nerves and shortness of breath no explanation at all was instantly given i am come in a great hurry it was all a mistake i never promised to go i told them from the first i could not go i ran away in a great hurry to explain it i did not care what you thought of me i would not stay for the servant the business however though not perfectly elucidated by this speech soon ceased to be a puzzle catherine found that john thorpe _ had _ given the message and miss tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it but whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment catherine though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication had no means of knowing whatever might have been felt before her arrival her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire the affair thus happily settled she was introduced by miss tilney to her father and received by him with such ready such solicitous politeness as recalled thorpe s information to her mind and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on to such anxious attention was the general s civility carried that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself what did william mean by it he should make a point of inquiring into the matter and if catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence it seemed likely that william would lose the favour of his master forever if not his place by her rapidity after sitting with them a quarter of an hour she rose to take leave and was then most agreeably surprised by general tilney s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her miss tilney added her own wishes catherine was greatly obliged but it was quite out of her power mr and mrs allen would expect her back every moment the general declared he could say no more the claims of mr and mrs allen were not to be superseded but on some other day he trusted when longer notice could be given they would not refuse to spare her to her friend oh no catherine was sure they would not have the least objection and she should have great pleasure in coming the general attended her himself to the street door saying everything gallant as they went downstairs admiring the elasticity of her walk which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld when they parted catherine delighted by all that had passed proceeded gaily to pulteney street walking as she concluded with great elasticity though she had never thought of it before she reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party and now that she had been triumphant throughout had carried her point and was secure of her walk she began as the flutter of her spirits subsided to doubt whether she had been perfectly right a sacrifice was always noble and if she had given way to their entreaties she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased a brother angry and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed perhaps through her means to ease her mind and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been she took occasion to mention before mr allen the half settled scheme of her brother and the thorpes for the following day mr allen caught at it directly well said he and do you think of going too no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i no certainly not and i am glad you do not think of it these schemes are not at all the thing young men and women driving about the country in open carriages now and then it is very well but going to inns and public places together it is not right and i wonder mrs thorpe should allow it i am glad you do not think of going i am sure mrs morland would not be pleased mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking do not you think these kind of projects objectionable yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed i cannot bear to see it dear madam cried catherine then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people _ will _ be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done said mr allen and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more that is just what i was going to say added his wife catherine relieved for herself felt uneasy for isabella and after a moment s thought asked mr allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to miss thorpe and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself for she considered that isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to clifton the next day in spite of what had passed mr allen however discouraged her from doing any such thing you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her mrs thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt but however you had better not interfere she and your brother choose to go and you will be only getting ill will catherine submitted and though sorry to think that isabella should be doing wrong felt greatly relieved by mr allen s approbation of her own conduct and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself her escape from being one of the party to clifton was now an escape indeed for what would the tilneys have thought of her if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety only to enable her to be guilty of another chapter 14 the next morning was fair and catherine almost expected another attack from the assembled party with mr allen to support her she felt no dread of the event but she would gladly be spared a contest where victory itself was painful and was heartily rejoiced therefore at neither seeing nor hearing anything of them the tilneys called for her at the appointed time and no new difficulty arising no sudden recollection no unexpected summons no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their measures my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement though it was made with the hero himself they determined on walking round beechen cliff that noble hill whose beautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object from almost every opening in bath i never look at it said catherine as they walked along the side of the river without thinking of the south of france you have been abroad then said henry a little surprised oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say why not because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time yes added miss tilney and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly it is _ amazingly _ it may well suggest _ amazement _ if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding henry said miss tilney you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way i am sure cried catherine i did not mean to say anything wrong but it _ is _ a nice book and why should not i call it so very true said henry and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word while in fact cried his sister it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading to say the truth i do not much like any other indeed that is i can read poetry and plays and things of that sort and do not dislike travels but history real solemn history i cannot be interested in can you yes i am fond of history i wish i were too i read it a little as a duty but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me the quarrels of popes and kings with wars or pestilences in every page the men all so good for nothing and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome and yet i often think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention the speeches that are put into the heroes mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention and invention is what delights me in other books historians you think said miss tilney are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it that little boys and girls should be tormented said henry is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to _ torment _ and to _ instruct _ might sometimes be used as synonymous words very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all catherine assented and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady s merits closed the subject the tilneys were soon engaged in another on which she had nothing to say they were viewing the country with the eyes of persons accustomed to drawing and decided on its capability of being formed into pictures with all the eagerness of real taste here catherine was quite lost she knew nothing of drawing nothing of taste and she listened to them with an attention which brought her little profit for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea to her the little which she could understand however appeared to contradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter before it seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the top of an high hill and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof of a fine day she was heartily ashamed of her ignorance a misplaced shame where people wish to attach they should always be ignorant to come with a well informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others which a sensible person would always wish to avoid a woman especially if she have the misfortune of knowing anything should conceal it as well as she can the advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author and to her treatment of the subject i will only add in justice to men that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex imbecility in females is a great enhancement of their personal charms there is a portion of them too reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance but catherine did not know her own advantages did not know that a good looking girl with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant mind cannot fail of attracting a clever young man unless circumstances are particularly untoward in the present instance she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge declared that she would give anything in the world to be able to draw and a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed in which his instructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in everything admired by him and her attention was so earnest that he became perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste he talked of foregrounds distances and second distances side screens and perspectives lights and shades and catherine was so hopeful a scholar that when they gained the top of beechen cliff she voluntarily rejected the whole city of bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape delighted with her progress and fearful of wearying her with too much wisdom at once henry suffered the subject to decline and by an easy transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak which he had placed near its summit to oaks in general to forests the enclosure of them waste lands crown lands and government he shortly found himself arrived at politics and from politics it was an easy step to silence the general pause which succeeded his short disquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by catherine who in rather a solemn tone of voice uttered these words i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london miss tilney to whom this was chiefly addressed was startled and hastily replied indeed and of what nature that i do not know nor who is the author i have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet good heaven where could you hear of such a thing a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind you speak with astonishing composure but i hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect government said henry endeavouring not to smile neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much the ladies stared he laughed and added come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot riot what riot my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general catherine looked grave and now henry said miss tilney that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways i shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them no doubt but that is no explanation of the present what am i to do you know what you ought to do clear your character handsomely before her tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women miss morland i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company that is not enough be more serious miss morland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland he is not in a sober mood but i do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me it was no effort to catherine to believe that henry tilney could never be wrong his manner might sometimes surprise but his meaning must always be just and what she did not understand she was almost as ready to admire as what she did the whole walk was delightful and though it ended too soon its conclusion was delightful too her friends attended her into the house and miss tilney before they parted addressing herself with respectful form as much to mrs allen as to catherine petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after the next no difficulty was made on mrs allen s side and the only difficulty on catherine s was in concealing the excess of her pleasure the morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her friendship and natural affection for no thought of isabella or james had crossed her during their walk when the tilneys were gone she became amiable again but she was amiable for some time to little effect mrs allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her anxiety she had heard nothing of any of them towards the end of the morning however catherine having occasion for some indispensable yard of ribbon which must be bought without a moment s delay walked out into the town and in bond street overtook the second miss thorpe as she was loitering towards edgar s buildings between two of the sweetest girls in the world who had been her dear friends all the morning from her she soon learned that the party to clifton had taken place they set off at eight this morning said miss anne and i am sure i do not envy them their drive i think you and i are very well off to be out of the scrape it must be the dullest thing in the world for there is not a soul at clifton at this time of year belle went with your brother and john drove maria catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of the arrangement oh yes rejoined the other maria is gone she was quite wild to go she thought it would be something very fine i cannot say i admire her taste and for my part i was determined from the first not to go if they pressed me ever so much catherine a little doubtful of this could not help answering i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go thank you but it is quite a matter of indifference to me indeed i would not have gone on any account i was saying so to emily and sophia when you overtook us catherine was still unconvinced but glad that anne should have the friendship of an emily and a sophia to console her she bade her adieu without much uneasiness and returned home pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either james or isabella to resent her resistance any longer chapter 15 early the next day a note from isabella speaking peace and tenderness in every line and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance hastened catherine in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity to edgar s buildings the two youngest miss thorpes were by themselves in the parlour and on anne s quitting it to call her sister catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday s party maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it and catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world that nobody could imagine how charming it had been and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive such was the information of the first five minutes the second unfolded thus much in detail that they had driven directly to the york hotel ate some soup and bespoke an early dinner walked down to the pump room tasted the water and laid out some shillings in purses and spars thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry cook s and hurrying back to the hotel swallowed their dinner in haste to prevent being in the dark and then had a delightful drive back only the moon was not up and it rained a little and mr morland s horse was so tired he could hardly get it along catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction it appeared that blaize castle had never been thought of and as for all the rest there was nothing to regret for half an instant maria s intelligence concluded with a tender effusion of pity for her sister anne whom she represented as insupportably cross from being excluded the party she will never forgive me i am sure but you know how could i help it john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had such thick ankles i dare say she will not be in good humour again this month but i am determined i will not be cross it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper isabella now entered the room with so eager a step and a look of such happy importance as engaged all her friend s notice maria was without ceremony sent away and isabella embracing catherine thus began yes my dear catherine it is so indeed your penetration has not deceived you oh that arch eye of yours it sees through everything catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance nay my beloved sweetest friend continued the other compose yourself i am amazingly agitated as you perceive let us sit down and talk in comfort well and so you guessed it the moment you had my note sly creature oh my dear catherine you alone who know my heart can judge of my present happiness your brother is the most charming of men i only wish i were more worthy of him but what will your excellent father and mother say oh heavens when i think of them i am so agitated catherine s understanding began to awake an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind and with the natural blush of so new an emotion she cried out good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james this bold surmise however she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact the anxious affection which she was accused of having continually watched in isabella s every look and action had in the course of their yesterday s party received the delightful confession of an equal love her heart and faith were alike engaged to james never had catherine listened to anything so full of interest wonder and joy her brother and her friend engaged new to such circumstances the importance of it appeared unspeakably great and she contemplated it as one of those grand events of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return the strength of her feelings she could not express the nature of them however contented her friend the happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion and the fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy delighting however as catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the connection it must be acknowledged that isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations you will be so infinitely dearer to me my catherine than either anne or maria i feel that i shall be so much more attached to my dear morland s family than to my own this was a pitch of friendship beyond catherine you are so like your dear brother continued isabella that i quite doted on you the first moment i saw you but so it always is with me the first moment settles everything the very first day that morland came to us last christmas the very first moment i beheld him my heart was irrecoverably gone i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braids and when i came into the drawing room and john introduced him i thought i never saw anybody so handsome before here catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love for though exceedingly fond of her brother and partial to all his endowments she had never in her life thought him handsome i remember too miss andrews drank tea with us that evening and wore her puce coloured sarsenet and she looked so heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her i could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it oh catherine the many sleepless nights i have had on your brother s account i would not have you suffer half what i have done i am grown wretchedly thin i know but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety you have seen enough of it i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church but my secret i was always sure would be safe with _ you _ catherine felt that nothing could have been safer but ashamed of an ignorance little expected she dared no longer contest the point nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as isabella chose to consider her her brother she found was preparing to set off with all speed to fullerton to make known his situation and ask consent and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of isabella catherine endeavoured to persuade her as she was herself persuaded that her father and mother would never oppose their son s wishes it is impossible said she for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children s happiness i have no doubt of their consenting immediately morland says exactly the same replied isabella and yet i dare not expect it my fortune will be so small they never can consent to it your brother who might marry anybody here catherine again discerned the force of love indeed isabella you are too humble the difference of fortune can be nothing to signify oh my sweet catherine in _ your _ generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were reversed had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice this charming sentiment recommended as much by sense as novelty gave catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea i am sure they will consent was her frequent declaration i am sure they will be delighted with you for my own part said isabella my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me where people are really attached poverty itself is wealth grandeur i detest i would not settle in london for the universe a cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy there are some charming little villas about richmond richmond cried catherine you must settle near fullerton you must be near us i am sure i shall be miserable if we do not if i can but be near _ you _ i shall be satisfied but this is idle talking i will not allow myself to think of such things till we have your father s answer morland says that by sending it to night to salisbury we may have it to morrow to morrow i know i shall never have courage to open the letter i know it will be the death of me a reverie succeeded this conviction and when isabella spoke again it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding gown their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for wiltshire catherine wished to congratulate him but knew not what to say and her eloquence was only in her eyes from them however the eight parts of speech shone out most expressively and james could combine them with ease impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home his adieus were not long and they would have been yet shorter had he not been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that he would go twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone indeed morland i must drive you away consider how far you have to ride i cannot bear to see you linger so for heaven s sake waste no more time there go go i insist on it the two friends with hearts now more united than ever were inseparable for the day and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along mrs thorpe and her son who were acquainted with everything and who seemed only to want mr morland s consent to consider isabella s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their family were allowed to join their counsels and add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters to catherine s simple feelings this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant nor consistently supported and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out had its inconsistency been less their friend but anne and maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their i know what and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit a display of family ingenuity on one side in the mystery of an affected secret on the other of undefined discovery all equally acute catherine was with her friend again the next day endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters a needful exertion for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near isabella became more and more desponding and before the letter arrived had worked herself into a state of real distress but when it did come where could distress be found i have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness were the first three lines and in one moment all was joyful security the brightest glow was instantly spread over isabella s features all care and anxiety seemed removed her spirits became almost too high for control and she called herself without scruple the happiest of mortals mrs thorpe with tears of joy embraced her daughter her son her visitor and could have embraced half the inhabitants of bath with satisfaction her heart was overflowing with tenderness it was dear john and dear catherine at every word dear anne and dear maria must immediately be made sharers in their felicity and two dears at once before the name of isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned john himself was no skulker in joy he not only bestowed on mr morland the high commendation of being one of the finest fellows in the world but swore off many sentences in his praise the letter whence sprang all this felicity was short containing little more than this assurance of success and every particular was deferred till james could write again but for particulars isabella could well afford to wait the needful was comprised in mr morland s promise his honour was pledged to make everything easy and by what means their income was to be formed whether landed property were to be resigned or funded money made over was a matter in which her disinterested spirit took no concern she knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities she saw herself at the end of a few weeks the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at fullerton the envy of every valued old friend in putney with a carriage at her command a new name on her tickets and a brilliant exhibition of hoop rings on her finger when the contents of the letter were ascertained john thorpe who had only waited its arrival to begin his journey to london prepared to set off well miss morland said he on finding her alone in the parlour i am come to bid you good bye catherine wished him a good journey without appearing to hear her he walked to the window fidgeted about hummed a tune and seemed wholly self occupied shall not you be late at devizes said catherine he made no answer but after a minute s silence burst out with a famous good thing this marrying scheme upon my soul a clever fancy of morland s and belle s what do you think of it miss morland _ i _ say it is no bad notion i am sure i think it a very good one do you that s honest by heavens i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony however did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another i say you will come to belle s wedding i hope yes i have promised your sister to be with her if possible and then you know twisting himself about and forcing a foolish laugh i say then you know we may try the truth of this same old song may we but i never sing well i wish you a good journey i dine with miss tilney to day and must now be going home nay but there is no such confounded hurry who knows when we may be together again not but that i shall be down again by the end of a fortnight and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me then why do you stay away so long replied catherine finding that he waited for an answer that is kind of you however kind and good natured i shall not forget it in a hurry but you have more good nature and all that than anybody living i believe a monstrous deal of good nature and it is not only good nature but you have so much so much of everything and then you have such upon my soul i do not know anybody like you oh dear there are a great many people like me i dare say only a great deal better good morning to you but i say miss morland i shall come and pay my respects at fullerton before it is long if not disagreeable pray do my father and mother will be very glad to see you and i hope i hope miss morland _ you _ will not be sorry to see me oh dear not at all there are very few people i am sorry to see company is always cheerful that is just my way of thinking give me but a little cheerful company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest say i and i am heartily glad to hear you say the same but i have a notion miss morland you and i think pretty much alike upon most matters perhaps we may but it is more than i ever thought of and as to _ most matters _ to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better very true i think like you there if there is a good fortune on one side there can be no occasion for any on the other no matter which has it so that there is enough i hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another and to marry for money i think the wickedest thing in existence good day we shall be very glad to see you at fullerton whenever it is convenient and away she went it was not in the power of all his gallantry to detain her longer with such news to communicate and such a visit to prepare for her departure was not to be delayed by anything in his nature to urge and she hurried away leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address and her explicit encouragement the agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her brother s engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion in mr and mrs allen by the communication of the wonderful event how great was her disappointment the important affair which many words of preparation ushered in had been foreseen by them both ever since her brother s arrival and all that they felt on the occasion was comprehended in a wish for the young people s happiness with a remark on the gentleman s side in favour of isabella s beauty and on the lady s of her great good luck it was to catherine the most surprising insensibility the disclosure however of the great secret of james s going to fullerton the day before did raise some emotion in mrs allen she could not listen to that with perfect calmness but repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment wished she could have known his intention wished she could have seen him before he went as she should certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father and mother and her kind compliments to all the skinners chapter 16 catherine s expectations of pleasure from her visit in milsom street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable and accordingly though she was most politely received by general tilney and kindly welcomed by his daughter though henry was at home and no one else of the party she found on her return without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with miss tilney from the intercourse of the day she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before instead of seeing henry tilney to greater advantage than ever in the ease of a family party he had never said so little nor been so little agreeable and in spite of their father s great civilities to her in spite of his thanks invitations and compliments it had been a release to get away from him it puzzled her to account for all this it could not be general tilney s fault that he was perfectly agreeable and good natured and altogether a very charming man did not admit of a doubt for he was tall and handsome and henry s father _ he _ could not be accountable for his children s want of spirits or for her want of enjoyment in his company the former she hoped at last might have been accidental and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity isabella on hearing the particulars of the visit gave a different explanation it was all pride pride insufferable haughtiness and pride she had long suspected the family to be very high and this made it certain such insolence of behaviour as miss tilney s she had never heard of in her life not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding to behave to her guest with such superciliousness hardly even to speak to her but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil oh don t defend her and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you good heavens well some people s feelings are incomprehensible and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits how contemptible of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine indeed he is unworthy of you unworthy i do not suppose he ever thinks of me that is exactly what i say he never thinks of you such fickleness oh how different to your brother and to mine i really believe john has the most constant heart but as for general tilney i assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy oh i know no harm of him i do not suspect him of pride i believe he is a very gentleman like man john thinks very well of him and john s judgment well i shall see how they behave to me this evening we shall meet them at the rooms and must i go do not you intend it i thought it was all settled nay since you make such a point of it i can refuse you nothing but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off and as for dancing do not mention it i beg _ that _ is quite out of the question charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guesses the reason and that is exactly what i want to avoid so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself isabella s opinion of the tilneys did not influence her friend she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts the evening rewarded her confidence she was met by one with the same kindness and by the other with the same attention as heretofore miss tilney took pains to be near her and henry asked her to dance having heard the day before in milsom street that their elder brother captain tilney was expected almost every hour she was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable looking handsome young man whom she had never seen before and who now evidently belonged to their party she looked at him with great admiration and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than his brother though in her eyes his air was more assuming and his countenance less prepossessing his taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior for within her hearing he not only protested against every thought of dancing himself but even laughed openly at henry for finding it possible from the latter circumstance it may be presumed that whatever might be our heroine s opinion of him his admiration of her was not of a very dangerous kind not likely to produce animosities between the brothers nor persecutions to the lady _ he _ cannot be the instigator of the three villains in horsemen s greatcoats by whom she will hereafter be forced into a traveling chaise and four which will drive off with incredible speed catherine meanwhile undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil or of any evil at all except that of having but a short set to dance down enjoyed her usual happiness with henry tilney listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said and in finding him irresistible becoming so herself at the end of the first dance captain tilney came towards them again and much to catherine s dissatisfaction pulled his brother away they retired whispering together and though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm and lay it down as fact that captain tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her which he now hastened to communicate to his brother in the hope of separating them forever she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without very uneasy sensations her suspense was of full five minutes duration and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour when they both returned and an explanation was given by henry s requesting to know if she thought her friend miss thorpe would have any objection to dancing as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to her catherine without hesitation replied that she was very sure miss thorpe did not mean to dance at all the cruel reply was passed on to the other and he immediately walked away your brother will not mind it i know said she because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world henry smiled and said how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions why what do you mean with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should _ i _ be influenced what would be _ my _ inducement in acting so and so i do not understand you then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible bravo an excellent satire on modern language but pray tell me what you mean shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us no no it shall not do either i am not afraid well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world catherine blushed and disclaimed and the gentleman s predictions were verified there was a something however in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time forgetting to speak or to listen and almost forgetting where she was till roused by the voice of isabella she looked up and saw her with captain tilney preparing to give them hands across isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given but as it was not quite enough for catherine s comprehension she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance and did isabella never change her mind before oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself you are laughing but i assure you isabella is very firm in general it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour the friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over but then as they walked about the room arm in arm isabella thus explained herself i do not wonder at your surprise and i am really fatigued to death he is such a rattle amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged but i would have given the world to sit still then why did not you oh my dear it would have looked so particular and you know how i abhor doing that i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial you have no idea how he pressed me i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner but no not he after aspiring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me oh such nonsense i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me for of all things in the world i hated fine speeches and compliments and so and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening i am so glad it is over my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us he is very handsome indeed handsome yes i suppose he may i dare say people would admire him in general but he is not at all in my style of beauty i hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man however he is very well amazingly conceited i am sure i took him down several times you know in my way when the young ladies next met they had a far more interesting subject to discuss james morland s second letter was then received and the kind intentions of his father fully explained a living of which mr morland was himself patron and incumbent of about four hundred pounds yearly value was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it no trifling deduction from the family income no niggardly assignment to one of ten children an estate of at least equal value moreover was assured as his future inheritance james expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry being however unwelcome no more than he had expected was borne by him without discontent catherine whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father s income and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother felt equally well satisfied and heartily congratulated isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled it is very charming indeed said isabella with a grave face mr morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed said the gentle mrs thorpe looking anxiously at her daughter i only wish i could do as much one could not expect more from him you know if he finds he _ can _ do more by and by i dare say he will for i am sure he must be an excellent good hearted man four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear it is not on my own account i wish for more but i cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life for myself it is nothing i never think of myself i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man nobody can think better of mr morland than i do i am sure but everybody has their failing you know and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money catherine was hurt by these insinuations i am very sure said she that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford isabella recollected herself as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living yes yes my darling isabella said mrs thorpe we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection catherine s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen she endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of isabella s regret and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise james soon followed his letter and was received with the most gratifying kindness chapter 17 the allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in bath and whether it should be the last was for some time a question to which catherine listened with a beating heart to have her acquaintance with the tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance her whole happiness seemed at stake while the affair was in suspense and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should be taken for another fortnight what this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing henry tilney made but a small part of catherine s speculation once or twice indeed since james s engagement had taught her what _ could _ be done she had got so far as to indulge in a secret perhaps but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views the present was now comprised in another three weeks and her happiness being certain for that period the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest in the course of the morning which saw this business arranged she visited miss tilney and poured forth her joyful feelings it was doomed to be a day of trial no sooner had she expressed her delight in mr allen s lengthened stay than miss tilney told her of her father s having just determined upon quitting bath by the end of another week here was a blow the past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment catherine s countenance fell and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed miss tilney s concluding words by the end of another week yes my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in a hurry to get home i am very sorry for it said catherine dejectedly if i had known this before perhaps said miss tilney in an embarrassed manner you would be so good it would make me very happy if the entrance of her father put a stop to the civility which catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding after addressing her with his usual politeness he turned to his daughter and said well eleanor may i congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in well proceed by all means i know how much your heart is in it my daughter miss morland he continued without leaving his daughter time to speak has been forming a very bold wish we leave bath as she has perhaps told you on saturday se nnight a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the marquis of longtown and general courteney here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath and could we carry our selfish point with you we should leave it without a single regret can you in short be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend eleanor with your company in gloucestershire i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in bath than yourself modesty such as yours but not for the world would i pain it by open praise if you can be induced to honour us with a visit you will make us happy beyond expression tis true we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour for our mode of living as you see is plain and unpretending yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable northanger abbey these were thrilling words and wound up catherine s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness to receive so flattering an invitation to have her company so warmly solicited everything honourable and soothing every present enjoyment and every future hope was contained in it and her acceptance with only the saving clause of papa and mamma s approbation was eagerly given i will write home directly said she and if they do not object as i dare say they will not general tilney was not less sanguine having already waited on her excellent friends in pulteney street and obtained their sanction of his wishes since they can consent to part with you said he we may expect philosophy from all the world miss tilney was earnest though gentle in her secondary civilities and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to fullerton would allow the circumstances of the morning had led catherine s feelings through the varieties of suspense security and disappointment but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss and with spirits elated to rapture with henry at her heart and northanger abbey on her lips she hurried home to write her letter mr and mrs morland relying on the discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their daughter felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under their eye and sent therefore by return of post their ready consent to her visit in gloucestershire this indulgence though not more than catherine had hoped for completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature in friends and fortune circumstance and chance everything seemed to cooperate for her advantage by the kindness of her first friends the allens she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her her feelings her preferences had each known the happiness of a return wherever she felt attachment she had been able to create it the affection of isabella was to be secured to her in a sister the tilneys they by whom above all she desired to be favourably thought of outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued she was to be their chosen visitor she was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized and in addition to all the rest this roof was to be the roof of an abbey her passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to her passion for henry tilney and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill to see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one or the cloisters of the other had been for many weeks a darling wish though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire and yet this was to happen with all the chances against her of house hall place park court and cottage northanger turned up an abbey and she was to be its inhabitant its long damp passages its narrow cells and ruined chapel were to be within her daily reach and she could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends some awful memorials of an injured and ill fated nun it was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home that the consciousness of it should be so meekly borne the power of early habit only could account for it a distinction to which they had been born gave no pride their superiority of abode was no more to them than their superiority of person many were the inquiries she was eager to make of miss tilney but so active were her thoughts that when these inquiries were answered she was hardly more assured than before of northanger abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the reformation of its having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the tilneys on its dissolution of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed or of its standing low in a valley sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak chapter 18 with a mind thus full of happiness catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away without her seeing isabella for more than a few minutes together she began first to be sensible of this and to sigh for her conversation as she walked along the pump room one morning by mrs allen s side without anything to say or to hear and scarcely had she felt a five minutes longing of friendship before the object of it appeared and inviting her to a secret conference led the way to a seat this is my favourite place said she as they sat down on a bench between the doors which commanded a tolerable view of everybody entering at either it is so out of the way catherine observing that isabella s eyes were continually bent towards one door or the other as in eager expectation and remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch thought the present a fine opportunity for being really so and therefore gaily said do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here psha my dear creature she replied do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow it would be hideous to be always together we should be the jest of the place and so you are going to northanger i am amazingly glad of it it is one of the finest old places in england i understand i shall depend upon a most particular description of it you shall certainly have the best in my power to give but who are you looking for are your sisters coming i am not looking for anybody one s eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles off i am amazingly absent i believe i am the most absent creature in the world tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me oh yes and so i have but here is a proof of what i was saying my poor head i had quite forgot it well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john you can guess the contents no indeed i cannot my sweet love do not be so abominably affected what can he write about but yourself you know he is over head and ears in love with you with _ me _ dear isabella nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance catherine with all the earnestness of truth expressed her astonishment at such a charge protesting her innocence of every thought of mr thorpe s being in love with her and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming and as to making me an offer or anything like it there must be some unaccountable mistake i could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind you know and as i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us the last half hour before he went away it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning but _ that _ you certainly did for you spent the whole morning in edgar s buildings it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house are you well if you say it it was so i dare say but for the life of me i cannot recollect it i _ do _ remember now being with you and seeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five minutes however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having no recollection of it that i never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side i never had the smallest idea of it pray undeceive him as soon as you can and tell him i beg his pardon that is i do not know what i ought to say but make him understand what i mean in the properest way i would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours isabella i am sure but you know very well that if i could think of one man more than another _ he _ is not the person isabella was silent my dear friend you must not be angry with me i cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me and you know we shall still be sisters yes yes with a blush there are more ways than one of our being sisters but where am i wandering to well my dear catherine the case seems to be that you are determined against poor john is not it so i certainly cannot return his affection and as certainly never meant to encourage it since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have but i confess as soon as i read his letter i thought it a very foolish imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either for what were you to live upon supposing you came together you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money i only wonder john could think of it he could not have received my last you _ do _ acquit me then of anything wrong you are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment oh as to that answered isabella laughingly i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been all that is best known to yourself a little harmless flirtation or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by but you may be assured that i am the last person in the world to judge you severely all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits what one means one day you know one may not mean the next circumstances change opinions alter but my opinion of your brother never did alter it was always the same you are describing what never happened my dearest catherine continued the other without at all listening to her i would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about i do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother because he is my brother and who perhaps after all you know might be just as happy without you for people seldom know what they would be at young men especially they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant what i say is why should a brother s happiness be dearer to me than a friend s you know i carry my notions of friendship pretty high but above all things my dear catherine do not be in a hurry take my word for it that if you are in too great a hurry you will certainly live to repent it tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections and i believe he is very right ah here he comes never mind he will not see us i am sure catherine looking up perceived captain tilney and isabella earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke soon caught his notice he approached immediately and took the seat to which her movements invited him his first address made catherine start though spoken low she could distinguish what always to be watched in person or by proxy psha nonsense was isabella s answer in the same half whisper why do you put such things into my head if i could believe it my spirit you know is pretty independent i wish your heart were independent that would be enough for me my heart indeed what can you have to do with hearts you men have none of you any hearts if we have not hearts we have eyes and they give us torment enough do they i am sorry for it i am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me i will look another way i hope this pleases you turning her back on him i hope your eyes are not tormented now never more so for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view at once too much and too little catherine heard all this and quite out of countenance could listen no longer amazed that isabella could endure it and jealous for her brother she rose up and saying she should join mrs allen proposed their walking but for this isabella showed no inclination she was so amazingly tired and it was so odious to parade about the pump room and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters she was expecting her sisters every moment so that her dearest catherine must excuse her and must sit quietly down again but catherine could be stubborn too and mrs allen just then coming up to propose their returning home she joined her and walked out of the pump room leaving isabella still sitting with captain tilney with much uneasiness did she thus leave them it seemed to her that captain tilney was falling in love with isabella and isabella unconsciously encouraging him unconsciously it must be for isabella s attachment to james was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement to doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible and yet during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd she wished isabella had talked more like her usual self and not so much about money and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of captain tilney how strange that she should not perceive his admiration catherine longed to give her a hint of it to put her on her guard and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother the compliment of john thorpe s affection did not make amends for this thoughtlessness in his sister she was almost as far from believing as from wishing it to be sincere for she had not forgotten that he could mistake and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious in vanity therefore she gained but little her chief profit was in wonder that he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment isabella talked of his attentions _ she _ had never been sensible of any but isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste and would never be said again and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort chapter 19 a few days passed away and catherine though not allowing herself to suspect her friend could not help watching her closely the result of her observations was not agreeable isabella seemed an altered creature when she saw her indeed surrounded only by their immediate friends in edgar s buildings or pulteney street her change of manners was so trifling that had it gone no farther it might have passed unnoticed a something of languid indifference or of that boasted absence of mind which catherine had never heard of before would occasionally come across her but had nothing worse appeared _ that _ might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest but when catherine saw her in public admitting captain tilney s attentions as readily as they were offered and allowing him almost an equal share with james in her notice and smiles the alteration became too positive to be passed over what could be meant by such unsteady conduct what her friend could be at was beyond her comprehension isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which catherine could not but resent james was the sufferer she saw him grave and uneasy and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart to _ her _ it was always an object for poor captain tilney too she was greatly concerned though his looks did not please her his name was a passport to her goodwill and she thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment for in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump room his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of isabella s engagement that she could not upon reflection imagine him aware of it he might be jealous of her brother as a rival but if more had seemed implied the fault must have been in her misapprehension she wished by a gentle remonstrance to remind isabella of her situation and make her aware of this double unkindness but for remonstrance either opportunity or comprehension was always against her if able to suggest a hint isabella could never understand it in this distress the intended departure of the tilney family became her chief consolation their journey into gloucestershire was to take place within a few days and captain tilney s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own but captain tilney had at present no intention of removing he was not to be of the party to northanger he was to continue at bath when catherine knew this her resolution was directly made she spoke to henry tilney on the subject regretting his brother s evident partiality for miss thorpe and entreating him to make known her prior engagement my brother does know it was henry s answer does he then why does he stay here he made no reply and was beginning to talk of something else but she eagerly continued why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable henry smiled and said i am sure my brother would not wish to do that then you will persuade him to go away persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master no he does not know what he is about cried catherine he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable and are you sure it is my brother s doing yes very sure is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain is not it the same thing i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment catherine blushed for her friend and said isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little after a short pause catherine resumed with then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother i can have no opinion on that subject but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour you are a very close questioner am i i only ask what i want to be told but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at well well nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture is pitiful the premises are before you my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her well said catherine after some moments consideration _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go my dear miss morland said henry in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave he added though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month catherine would contend no longer against comfort she had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech but it now carried her captive henry tilney must know best she blamed herself for the extent of her fears and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again her resolution was supported by isabella s behaviour in their parting interview the thorpes spent the last evening of catherine s stay in pulteney street and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness or make her quit them in apprehension james was in excellent spirits and isabella most engagingly placid her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart but that at such a moment was allowable and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction and once she drew back her hand but catherine remembered henry s instructions and placed it all to judicious affection the embraces tears and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied chapter 20 mr and mrs allen were sorry to lose their young friend whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased her happiness in going with miss tilney however prevented their wishing it otherwise and as they were to remain only one more week in bath themselves her quitting them now would not long be felt mr allen attended her to milsom street where she was to breakfast and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right and of not being able to preserve their good opinion that in the embarrassment of the first five minutes she could almost have wished to return with him to pulteney street miss tilney s manners and henry s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings but still she was far from being at ease nor could the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure her nay perverse as it seemed she doubted whether she might not have felt less had she been less attended to his anxiety for her comfort his continual solicitations that she would eat and his often expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast table made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor she felt utterly unworthy of such respect and knew not how to reply to it her tranquillity was not improved by the general s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when captain tilney at last came down she was quite pained by the severity of his father s reproof which seemed disproportionate to the offence and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her this was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation and she felt great compassion for captain tilney without being able to hope for his goodwill he listened to his father in silence and attempted not any defence which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind on isabella s account might by keeping him long sleepless have been the real cause of his rising late it was the first time of her being decidedly in his company and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room and even afterwards so much were his spirits affected she could distinguish nothing but these words in a whisper to eleanor how glad i shall be when you are all off the bustle of going was not pleasant the clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down and the general had fixed to be out of milsom street by that hour his greatcoat instead of being brought for him to put on directly was spread out in the curricle in which he was to accompany his son the middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out though there were three people to go in it and his daughter s maid had so crowded it with parcels that miss morland would not have room to sit and so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing desk from being thrown out into the street at last however the door was closed upon the three females and they set off at the sober pace in which the handsome highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles such was the distance of northanger from bath to be now divided into two equal stages catherine s spirits revived as they drove from the door for with miss tilney she felt no restraint and with the interest of a road entirely new to her of an abbey before and a curricle behind she caught the last view of bath without any regret and met with every milestone before she expected it the tediousness of a two hours wait at petty france in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry and loiter about without anything to see next followed and her admiration of the style in which they travelled of the fashionable chaise and four postilions handsomely liveried rising so regularly in their stirrups and numerous outriders properly mounted sunk a little under this consequent inconvenience had their party been perfectly agreeable the delay would have been nothing but general tilney though so charming a man seemed always a check upon his children s spirits and scarcely anything was said but by himself the observation of which with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded and his angry impatience at the waiters made catherine grow every moment more in awe of him and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four at last however the order of release was given and much was catherine then surprised by the general s proposal of her taking his place in his son s curricle for the rest of the journey the day was fine and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible the remembrance of mr allen s opinion respecting young men s open carriages made her blush at the mention of such a plan and her first thought was to decline it but her second was of greater deference for general tilney s judgment he could not propose anything improper for her and in the course of a few minutes she found herself with henry in the curricle as happy a being as ever existed a very short trial convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur to be sure but it was a heavy and troublesome business and she could not easily forget its having stopped two hours at petty france half the time would have been enough for the curricle and so nimbly were the light horses disposed to move that had not the general chosen to have his own carriage lead the way they could have passed it with ease in half a minute but the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses henry drove so well so quietly without making any disturbance without parading to her or swearing at them so different from the only gentleman coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with and then his hat sat so well and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat looked so becomingly important to be driven by him next to being dancing with him was certainly the greatest happiness in the world in addition to every other delight she had now that of listening to her own praise of being thanked at least on his sister s account for her kindness in thus becoming her visitor of hearing it ranked as real friendship and described as creating real gratitude his sister he said was uncomfortably circumstanced she had no female companion and in the frequent absence of her father was sometimes without any companion at all but how can that be said catherine are not you with her northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there how sorry you must be for that i am always sorry to leave eleanor yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable he smiled and said you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you oh but this will not happen to me i am sure how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your _ unconquerable _ horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the _ third _ night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness oh no no do not say so well go on but henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able to carry it farther he could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of matilda s woes catherine recollecting herself grew ashamed of her eagerness and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related miss tilney she was sure would never put her into such a chamber as he had described she was not at all afraid as they drew near the end of their journey her impatience for a sight of the abbey for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects very different returned in full force and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high gothic windows but so low did the building stand that she found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of northanger without having discerned even an antique chimney she knew not that she had any right to be surprised but there was a something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected to pass between lodges of a modern appearance to find herself with such ease in the very precincts of the abbey and driven so rapidly along a smooth level road of fine gravel without obstacle alarm or solemnity of any kind struck her as odd and inconsistent she was not long at leisure however for such considerations a sudden scud of rain driving full in her face made it impossible for her to observe anything further and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw bonnet and she was actually under the abbey walls was springing with henry s assistance from the carriage was beneath the shelter of the old porch and had even passed on to the hall where her friend and the general were waiting to welcome her without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to herself or one moment s suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice the breeze had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her it had wafted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain and having given a good shake to her habit she was ready to be shown into the common drawing room and capable of considering where she was an abbey yes it was delightful to be really in an abbey but she doubted as she looked round the room whether anything within her observation would have given her the consciousness the furniture was in all the profusion and elegance of modern taste the fireplace where she had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times was contracted to a rumford with slabs of plain though handsome marble and ornaments over it of the prettiest english china the windows to which she looked with peculiar dependence from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in their gothic form with reverential care were yet less what her fancy had portrayed to be sure the pointed arch was preserved the form of them was gothic they might be even casements but every pane was so large so clear so light to an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions and the heaviest stone work for painted glass dirt and cobwebs the difference was very distressing the general perceiving how her eye was employed began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture where everything being for daily use pretended only to comfort etc flattering himself however that there were some apartments in the abbey not unworthy her notice and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular when taking out his watch he stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five this seemed the word of separation and catherine found herself hurried away by miss tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctuality to the family hours would be expected at northanger returning through the large and lofty hall they ascended a broad staircase of shining oak which after many flights and many landing places brought them upon a long wide gallery on one side it had a range of doors and it was lighted on the other by windows which catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle before miss tilney led the way into a chamber and scarcely staying to hope she would find it comfortable left her with an anxious entreaty that she would make as little alteration as possible in her dress chapter 21 a moment s glance was enough to satisfy catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of it was by no means unreasonably large and contained neither tapestry nor velvet the walls were papered the floor was carpeted the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those of the drawing room below the furniture though not of the latest fashion was handsome and comfortable and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful her heart instantaneously at ease on this point she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything as she greatly dreaded disobliging the general by any delay her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste and she was preparing to unpin the linen package which the chaise seat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation when her eye suddenly fell on a large high chest standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace the sight of it made her start and forgetting everything else she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder while these thoughts crossed her this is strange indeed i did not expect such a sight as this an immense heavy chest what can it hold why should it be placed here pushed back too as if meant to be out of sight i will look into it cost me what it may i will look into it and directly too by daylight if i stay till evening my candle may go out she advanced and examined it closely it was of cedar curiously inlaid with some darker wood and raised about a foot from the ground on a carved stand of the same the lock was silver though tarnished from age at each end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver broken perhaps prematurely by some strange violence and on the centre of the lid was a mysterious cipher in the same metal catherine bent over it intently but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty she could not in whatever direction she took it believe the last letter to be a _ t _ and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment if not originally theirs by what strange events could it have fallen into the tilney family her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater and seizing with trembling hands the hasp of the lock she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its contents with difficulty for something seemed to resist her efforts she raised the lid a few inches but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her starting quit her hold and the lid closed with alarming violence this ill timed intruder was miss tilney s maid sent by her mistress to be of use to miss morland and though catherine immediately dismissed her it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing and forced her in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery to proceed in her dressing without further delay her progress was not quick for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt she could not remain many paces from the chest at length however having slipped one arm into her gown her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged one moment surely might be spared and so desperate should be the exertion of her strength that unless secured by supernatural means the lid in one moment should be thrown back with this spirit she sprang forward and her confidence did not deceive her her resolute effort threw back the lid and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane properly folded reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession she was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when miss tilney anxious for her friend s being ready entered the room and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search that is a curious old chest is not it said miss tilney as catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets the worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open in that corner however it is at least out of the way catherine had no leisure for speech being at once blushing tying her gown and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch miss tilney gently hinted her fear of being late and in half a minute they ran downstairs together in an alarm not wholly unfounded for general tilney was pacing the drawing room his watch in his hand and having on the very instant of their entering pulled the bell with violence ordered dinner to be on table _ directly _ catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke and sat pale and breathless in a most humble mood concerned for his children and detesting old chests and the general recovering his politeness as he looked at her spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend who was absolutely out of breath from haste when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world but catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself till they were happily seated at the dinner table when the general s complacent smiles and a good appetite of her own restored her to peace the dining parlour was a noble room suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing room than the one in common use and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of catherine who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants of the former she spoke aloud her admiration and the general with a very gracious countenance acknowledged that it was by no means an ill sized room and further confessed that though as careless on such subjects as most people he did look upon a tolerably large eating room as one of the necessaries of life he supposed however that she must have been used to much better sized apartments at mr allen s no indeed was catherine s honest assurance mr allen s dining parlour was not more than half as large and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life the general s good humour increased why as he _ had _ such rooms he thought it would be simple not to make use of them but upon his honour he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half their size mr allen s house he was sure must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness the evening passed without any further disturbance and in the occasional absence of general tilney with much positive cheerfulness it was only in his presence that catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey and even then even in moments of languor or restraint a sense of general happiness preponderated and she could think of her friends in bath without one wish of being with them the night was stormy the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon and by the time the party broke up it blew and rained violently catherine as she crossed the hall listened to the tempest with sensations of awe and when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey yes these were characteristic sounds they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes which such buildings had witnessed and such storms ushered in and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn _ she _ had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning in a house so furnished and so guarded she could have nothing to explore or to suffer and might go to her bedroom as securely as if it had been her own chamber at fullerton thus wisely fortifying her mind as she proceeded upstairs she was enabled especially on perceiving that miss tilney slept only two doors from her to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire how much better is this said she as she walked to the fender how much better to find a fire ready lit than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed as so many poor girls have been obliged to do and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot how glad i am that northanger is what it is if it had been like some other places i do not know that in such a night as this i could have answered for my courage but now to be sure there is nothing to alarm one she looked round the room the window curtains seemed in motion it could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the divisions of the shutters and she stepped boldly forward carelessly humming a tune to assure herself of its being so peeped courageously behind each curtain saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her and on placing a hand against the shutter felt the strongest conviction of the wind s force a glance at the old chest as she turned away from this examination was not without its use she scorned the causeless fears of an idle fancy and began with a most happy indifference to prepare herself for bed she should take her time she should not hurry herself she did not care if she were the last person up in the house but she would not make up her fire _ that _ would seem cowardly as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed the fire therefore died away and catherine having spent the best part of an hour in her arrangements was beginning to think of stepping into bed when on giving a parting glance round the room she was struck by the appearance of a high old fashioned black cabinet which though in a situation conspicuous enough had never caught her notice before henry s words his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first immediately rushed across her and though there could be nothing really in it there was something whimsical it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence she took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet it was not absolutely ebony and gold but it was japan black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind and as she held her candle the yellow had very much the effect of gold the key was in the door and she had a strange fancy to look into it not however with the smallest expectation of finding anything but it was so very odd after what henry had said in short she could not sleep till she had examined it so placing the candle with great caution on a chair she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn it but it resisted her utmost strength alarmed but not discouraged she tried it another way a bolt flew and she believed herself successful but how strangely mysterious the door was still immovable she paused a moment in breathless wonder the wind roared down the chimney the rain beat in torrents against the windows and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation to retire to bed however unsatisfied on such a point would be vain since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity again therefore she applied herself to the key and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope s last effort the door suddenly yielded to her hand her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory and having thrown open each folding door the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual a double range of small drawers appeared in view with some larger drawers above and below them and in the centre a small door closed also with a lock and key secured in all probability a cavity of importance catherine s heart beat quick but her courage did not fail her with a cheek flushed by hope and an eye straining with curiosity her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth it was entirely empty with less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second a third a fourth each was equally empty not one was left unsearched and in not one was anything found well read in the art of concealing a treasure the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain the place in the middle alone remained now unexplored and though she had never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it it was some time however before she could unfasten the door the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer but at length it did open and not vain as hitherto was her search her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity apparently for concealment and her feelings at that moment were indescribable her heart fluttered her knees trembled and her cheeks grew pale she seized with an unsteady hand the precious manuscript for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what henry had foretold resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest the dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm but there was no danger of its sudden extinction it had yet some hours to burn and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion she hastily snuffed it alas it was snuffed and extinguished in one a lamp could not have expired with more awful effect catherine for a few moments was motionless with horror it was done completely not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room a violent gust of wind rising with sudden fury added fresh horror to the moment catherine trembled from head to foot in the pause which succeeded a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear human nature could support no more a cold sweat stood on her forehead the manuscript fell from her hand and groping her way to the bed she jumped hastily in and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes to close her eyes in sleep that night she felt must be entirely out of the question with a curiosity so justly awakened and feelings in every way so agitated repose must be absolutely impossible the storm too abroad so dreadful she had not been used to feel alarm from wind but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence the manuscript so wonderfully found so wonderfully accomplishing the morning s prediction how was it to be accounted for what could it contain to whom could it relate by what means could it have been so long concealed and how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it till she had made herself mistress of its contents however she could have neither repose nor comfort and with the sun s first rays she was determined to peruse it but many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene she shuddered tossed about in her bed and envied every quiet sleeper the storm still raged and various were the noises more terrific even than the wind which struck at intervals on her startled ear the very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion and at another the lock of her door was agitated as if by the attempt of somebody to enter hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans hour after hour passed away and the wearied catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep chapter 22 the housemaid s folding back her window shutters at eight o clock the next day was the sound which first roused catherine and she opened her eyes wondering that they could ever have been closed on objects of cheerfulness her fire was already burning and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night instantaneously with the consciousness of existence returned her recollection of the manuscript and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid s going away she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow she now plainly saw that she must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had shuddered over in books for the roll seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets was altogether but of trifling size and much less than she had supposed it to be at first her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page she started at its import could it be possible or did not her senses play her false an inventory of linen in coarse and modern characters seemed all that was before her if the evidence of sight might be trusted she held a washing bill in her hand she seized another sheet and saw the same articles with little variation a third a fourth and a fifth presented nothing new shirts stockings cravats and waistcoats faced her in each two others penned by the same hand marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting in letters hair powder shoe string and breeches ball and the larger sheet which had enclosed the rest seemed by its first cramp line to poultice chestnut mare a farrier s bill such was the collection of papers left perhaps as she could then suppose by the negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them which had filled her with expectation and alarm and robbed her of half her night s rest she felt humbled to the dust could not the adventure of the chest have taught her wisdom a corner of it catching her eye as she lay seemed to rise up in judgment against her nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies to suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that so modern so habitable or that she should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet the key of which was open to all how could she have so imposed on herself heaven forbid that henry tilney should ever know her folly and it was in a great measure his own doing for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his description of her adventures she should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it this was the only comfort that occurred impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly those detestable papers then scattered over the bed she rose directly and folding them up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before returned them to the same spot within the cabinet with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring them forward again to disgrace her even with herself why the locks should have been so difficult to open however was still something remarkable for she could now manage them with perfect ease in this there was surely something mysterious and she indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute till the possibility of the door s having been at first unlocked and of being herself its fastener darted into her head and cost her another blush she got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct produced such unpleasant reflections and found her way with all speed to the breakfast parlour as it had been pointed out to her by miss tilney the evening before henry was alone in it and his immediate hope of her having been undisturbed by the tempest with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited was rather distressing for the world would she not have her weakness suspected and yet unequal to an absolute falsehood was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept her awake a little but we have a charming morning after it she added desiring to get rid of the subject and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over what beautiful hyacinths i have just learnt to love a hyacinth and how might you learn by accident or argument your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the general whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure the elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on catherine s notice when they were seated at table and luckily it had been the general s choice he was enchanted by her approbation of his taste confessed it to be neat and simple thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country and for his part to his uncritical palate the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of staffordshire as from that of dresden or sêve but this was quite an old set purchased two years ago the manufacture was much improved since that time he had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town and had he not been perfectly without vanity of that kind might have been tempted to order a new set he trusted however that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one though not for himself catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him shortly after breakfast henry left them for woodston where business required and would keep him two or three days they all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse and immediately on re entering the breakfast room catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure this is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother s fortitude observed the general to eleanor woodston will make but a sombre appearance to day is it a pretty place asked catherine what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession the imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes the silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house and he now offered himself as her conductor and though catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself under any circumstances not to be gladly accepted for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey and had seen only a few of its rooms the netting box just leisurely drawn forth was closed with joyful haste and she was ready to attend him in a moment and when they had gone over the house he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden she curtsied her acquiescence but perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object the weather was at present favourable and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so which would she prefer he was equally at her service which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend s wishes but he thought he could discern yes he certainly read in miss morland s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather but when did she judge amiss the abbey would be always safe and dry he yielded implicitly and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment he left the room and catherine with a disappointed anxious face began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination under a mistaken idea of pleasing her but she was stopped by miss tilney s saying with a little confusion i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood why was miss tilney embarrassed could there be any unwillingness on the general s side to show her over the abbey the proposal was his own and was not it odd that he should _ always _ take his walk so early neither her father nor mr allen did so it was certainly very provoking she was all impatience to see the house and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds if henry had been with them indeed but now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it such were her thoughts but she kept them to herself and put on her bonnet in patient discontent she was struck however beyond her expectation by the grandeur of the abbey as she saw it for the first time from the lawn the whole building enclosed a large court and two sides of the quadrangle rich in gothic ornaments stood forward for admiration the remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees or luxuriant plantations and the steep woody hills rising behind to give it shelter were beautiful even in the leafless month of march catherine had seen nothing to compare with it and her feelings of delight were so strong that without waiting for any better authority she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise the general listened with assenting gratitude and it seemed as if his own estimation of northanger had waited unfixed till that hour the kitchen garden was to be next admired and he led the way to it across a small portion of the park the number of acres contained in this garden was such as catherine could not listen to without dismay being more than double the extent of all mr allen s as well as her father s including church yard and orchard the walls seemed countless in number endless in length a village of hot houses seemed to arise among them and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure the general was flattered by her looks of surprise which told him almost as plainly as he soon forced her to tell him in words that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before and he then modestly owned that without any ambition of that sort himself without any solicitude about it he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom if he had a hobby horse it was _ that _ he loved a garden though careless enough in most matters of eating he loved good fruit or if he did not his friends and children did there were great vexations however attending such a garden as his the utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits the pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year mr allen he supposed must feel these inconveniences as well as himself no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it with a triumphant smile of self satisfaction the general wished he could do the same for he never entered his without being vexed in some way or other by its falling short of his plan how were mr allen s succession houses worked describing the nature of his own as they entered them mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then he is a happy man said the general with a look of very happy contempt having taken her into every division and led her under every wall till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea house proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk if miss morland were not tired but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park this is so favourite a walk of mine said miss tilney that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp it was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old scotch firs and catherine struck by its gloomy aspect and eager to enter it could not even by the general s disapprobation be kept from stepping forward he perceived her inclination and having again urged the plea of health in vain was too polite to make further opposition he excused himself however from attending them the rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him and he would meet them by another course he turned away and catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation the shock however being less real than the relief offered it no injury and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired i am particularly fond of this spot said her companion with a sigh it was my mother s favourite walk catherine had never heard mrs tilney mentioned in the family before and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more i used to walk here so often with her added eleanor though i never loved it then as i have loved it since at that time indeed i used to wonder at her choice but her memory endears it now and ought it not reflected catherine to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it miss tilney continuing silent she ventured to say her death must have been a great affliction a great and increasing one replied the other in a low voice i was only thirteen when it happened and though i felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it i did not i could not then know what a loss it was she stopped for a moment and then added with great firmness i have no sister you know and though henry though my brothers are very affectionate and henry is a great deal here which i am most thankful for it is impossible for me not to be often solitary to be sure you must miss him very much a mother would have been always present a mother would have been a constant friend her influence would have been beyond all other was she a very charming woman was she handsome was there any picture of her in the abbey and why had she been so partial to that grove was it from dejection of spirits were questions now eagerly poured forth the first three received a ready affirmative the two others were passed by and catherine s interest in the deceased mrs tilney augmented with every question whether answered or not of her unhappiness in marriage she felt persuaded the general certainly had been an unkind husband he did not love her walk could he therefore have loved her and besides handsome as he was there was a something in the turn of his features which spoke his not having behaved well to her her picture i suppose blushing at the consummate art of her own question hangs in your father s room no it was intended for the drawing room but my father was dissatisfied with the painting and for some time it had no place soon after her death i obtained it for my own and hung it in my bed chamber where i shall be happy to show it you it is very like here was another proof a portrait very like of a departed wife not valued by the husband he must have been dreadfully cruel to her catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which in spite of all his attentions he had previously excited and what had been terror and dislike before was now absolute aversion yes aversion his cruelty to such a charming woman made him odious to her she had often read of such characters characters which mr allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn but here was proof positive of the contrary she had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the general and in spite of all her virtuous indignation she found herself again obliged to walk with him listen to him and even to smile when he smiled being no longer able however to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects she soon began to walk with lassitude the general perceived it and with a concern for her health which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him was most urgent for returning with his daughter to the house he would follow them in a quarter of an hour again they parted but eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round the abbey till his return this second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck catherine as very remarkable chapter 23 an hour passed away before the general came in spent on the part of his young guest in no very favourable consideration of his character this lengthened absence these solitary rambles did not speak a mind at ease or a conscience void of reproach at length he appeared and whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations he could still smile with _ them _ miss tilney understanding in part her friend s curiosity to see the house soon revived the subject and her father being contrary to catherine s expectations unprovided with any pretence for further delay beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return was at last ready to escort them they set forward and with a grandeur of air a dignified step which caught the eye but could not shake the doubts of the well read catherine he led the way across the hall through the common drawing room and one useless antechamber into a room magnificent both in size and furniture the real drawing room used only with company of consequence it was very noble very grand very charming was all that catherine had to say for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin and all minuteness of praise all praise that had much meaning was supplied by the general the costliness or elegance of any room s fitting up could be nothing to her she cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century when the general had satisfied his own curiosity in a close examination of every well known ornament they proceeded into the library an apartment in its way of equal magnificence exhibiting a collection of books on which an humble man might have looked with pride catherine heard admired and wondered with more genuine feeling than before gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge by running over the titles of half a shelf and was ready to proceed but suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes large as was the building she had already visited the greatest part though on being told that with the addition of the kitchen the six or seven rooms she had now seen surrounded three sides of the court she could scarcely believe it or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted it was some relief however that they were to return to the rooms in common use by passing through a few of less importance looking into the court which with occasional passages not wholly unintricate connected the different sides and she was further soothed in her progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a cloister having traces of cells pointed out and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to her by finding herself successively in a billiard room and in the general s private apartment without comprehending their connection or being able to turn aright when she left them and lastly by passing through a dark little room owning henry s authority and strewed with his litter of books guns and greatcoats from the dining room of which though already seen and always to be seen at five o clock the general could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length for the more certain information of miss morland as to what she neither doubted nor cared for they proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen the ancient kitchen of the convent rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days and in the stoves and hot closets of the present the general s improving hand had not loitered here every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this their spacious theatre and when the genius of others had failed his own had often produced the perfection wanted his endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high among the benefactors of the convent with the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey the fourth side of the quadrangle having on account of its decaying state been removed by the general s father and the present erected in its place all that was venerable ceased here the new building was not only new but declared itself to be so intended only for offices and enclosed behind by stable yards no uniformity of architecture had been thought necessary catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest for the purposes of mere domestic economy and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen had the general allowed it but if he had a vanity it was in the arrangement of his offices and as he was convinced that to a mind like miss morland s a view of the accommodations and comforts by which the labours of her inferiors were softened must always be gratifying he should make no apology for leading her on they took a slight survey of all and catherine was impressed beyond her expectation by their multiplicity and their convenience the purposes for which a few shapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at fullerton were here carried on in appropriate divisions commodious and roomy the number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than the number of their offices wherever they went some pattened girl stopped to curtsy or some footman in dishabille sneaked off yet this was an abbey how inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as she had read about from abbeys and castles in which though certainly larger than northanger all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost how they could get through it all had often amazed mrs allen and when catherine saw what was necessary here she began to be amazed herself they returned to the hall that the chief staircase might be ascended and the beauty of its wood and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out having gained the top they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which her room lay and shortly entered one on the same plan but superior in length and breadth she was here shown successively into three large bed chambers with their dressing rooms most completely and handsomely fitted up everything that money and taste could do to give comfort and elegance to apartments had been bestowed on these and being furnished within the last five years they were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing and wanting in all that could give pleasure to catherine as they were surveying the last the general after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom they had at times been honoured turned with a smiling countenance to catherine and ventured to hope that henceforward some of their earliest tenants might be our friends from fullerton she felt the unexpected compliment and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself and so full of civility to all her family the gallery was terminated by folding doors which miss tilney advancing had thrown open and passed through and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left in another long reach of gallery when the general coming forwards called her hastily and as catherine thought rather angrily back demanding whither she were going and what was there more to be seen had not miss morland already seen all that could be worth her notice and did she not suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise miss tilney drew back directly and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified catherine who having seen in a momentary glance beyond them a narrower passage more numerous openings and symptoms of a winding staircase believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice and felt as she unwillingly paced back the gallery that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest the general s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant something was certainly to be concealed her fancy though it had trespassed lately once or twice could not mislead her here and what that something was a short sentence of miss tilney s as they followed the general at some distance downstairs seemed to point out i was going to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died were all her words but few as they were they conveyed pages of intelligence to catherine it was no wonder that the general should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain a room in all probability never entered by him since the dreadful scene had passed which released his suffering wife and left him to the stings of conscience she ventured when next alone with eleanor to express her wish of being permitted to see it as well as all the rest of that side of the house and eleanor promised to attend her there whenever they should have a convenient hour catherine understood her the general must be watched from home before that room could be entered it remains as it was i suppose said she in a tone of feeling yes entirely and how long ago may it be that your mother died she has been dead these nine years and nine years catherine knew was a trifle of time compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife before her room was put to rights you were with her i suppose to the last no said miss tilney sighing i was unfortunately from home her illness was sudden and short and before i arrived it was all over catherine s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words could it be possible could henry s father and yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions and when she saw him in the evening while she worked with her friend slowly pacing the drawing room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness with downcast eyes and contracted brow she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him it was the air and attitude of a montoni what could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity in its fearful review of past scenes of guilt unhappy man and the anxiousness of her spirits directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly as to catch miss tilney s notice my father she whispered often walks about the room in this way it is nothing unusual so much the worse thought catherine such ill timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks and boded nothing good after an evening the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of henry s importance among them she was heartily glad to be dismissed though it was a look from the general not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell when the butler would have lit his master s candle however he was forbidden the latter was not going to retire i have many pamphlets to finish said he to catherine before i can close my eyes and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep can either of us be more meetly employed _ my _ eyes will be blinding for the good of others and _ yours _ preparing by rest for future mischief but neither the business alleged nor the magnificent compliment could win catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose to be kept up for hours after the family were in bed by stupid pamphlets was not very likely there must be some deeper cause something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept and the probability that mrs tilney yet lived shut up for causes unknown and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food was the conclusion which necessarily followed shocking as was the idea it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened as in the natural course of things she must ere long be released the suddenness of her reputed illness the absence of her daughter and probably of her other children at the time all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment its origin jealousy perhaps or wanton cruelty was yet to be unravelled in revolving these matters while she undressed it suddenly struck her as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman s confinement might have been within a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division in the high arched passage paved with stone which already she had trodden with peculiar awe she well remembered the doors of which the general had given no account to what might not those doors lead in support of the plausibility of this conjecture it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate mrs tilney must be as certainly as her memory could guide her exactly over this suspected range of cells and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which she had caught a transient glimpse communicating by some secret means with those cells might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well prepared insensibility catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible the side of the quadrangle in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting being according to her belief just opposite her own it struck her that if judiciously watched some rays of light from the general s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows as he passed to the prison of his wife and twice before she stepped into bed she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery to see if it appeared but all abroad was dark and it must yet be too early the various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up till midnight she supposed it would be in vain to watch but then when the clock had struck twelve and all was quiet she would if not quite appalled by darkness steal out and look once more the clock struck twelve and catherine had been half an hour asleep chapter 24 the next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments it was sunday and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home and great as was catherine s curiosity her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o clock or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp the day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of mrs tilney which immediately fronted the family pew by that her eye was instantly caught and long retained and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband who must have been in some way or other her destroyer affected her even to tears that the general having erected such a monument should be able to face it was not perhaps very strange and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view maintain so elevated an air look so fearlessly around nay that he should even enter the church seemed wonderful to catherine not however that many instances of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced she could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice going on from crime to crime murdering whomsoever they chose without any feeling of humanity or remorse till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career the erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of mrs tilney s actual decease were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed what could it avail in such a case catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced and a supposititious funeral carried on the succeeding morning promised something better the general s early walk ill timed as it was in every other view was favourable here and when she knew him to be out of the house she directly proposed to miss tilney the accomplishment of her promise eleanor was ready to oblige her and catherine reminding her as they went of another promise their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed chamber it represented a very lovely woman with a mild and pensive countenance justifying so far the expectations of its new observer but they were not in every respect answered for catherine had depended upon meeting with features hair complexion that should be the very counterpart the very image if not of henry s of eleanor s the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child a face once taken was taken for generations but here she was obliged to look and consider and study for a likeness she contemplated it however in spite of this drawback with much emotion and but for a yet stronger interest would have left it unwillingly her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse she could only look at her companion eleanor s countenance was dejected yet sedate and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing again she passed through the folding doors again her hand was upon the important lock and catherine hardly able to breathe was turning to close the former with fearful caution when the figure the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery stood before her the name of eleanor at the same moment in his loudest tone resounded through the building giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence and to catherine terror upon terror an attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye and when her friend who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her had joined and disappeared with him she ran for safety to her own room and locking herself in believed that she should never have courage to go down again she remained there at least an hour in the greatest agitation deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend and expecting a summons herself from the angry general to attend him in his own apartment no summons however arrived and at last on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors the breakfast room was gay with company and she was named to them by the general as the friend of his daughter in a complimentary style which so well concealed his resentful ire as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present and eleanor with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his character taking an early occasion of saying to her my father only wanted me to answer a note she began to hope that she had either been unseen by the general or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so upon this trust she dared still to remain in his presence after the company left them and nothing occurred to disturb it in the course of this morning s reflections she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone it would be much better in every respect that eleanor should know nothing of the matter to involve her in the danger of a second detection to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart could not be the office of a friend the general s utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter and besides she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion it would be impossible to explain to eleanor the suspicions from which the other had in all likelihood been hitherto happily exempt nor could she therefore in _ her _ presence search for those proofs of the general s cruelty which however they might yet have escaped discovery she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth in the shape of some fragmented journal continued to the last gasp of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress and as she wished to get it over before henry s return who was expected on the morrow there was no time to be lost the day was bright her courage high at four o clock the sun was now two hours above the horizon and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual it was done and catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike it was no time for thought she hurried on slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors and without stopping to look or breathe rushed forward to the one in question the lock yielded to her hand and luckily with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being on tiptoe she entered the room was before her but it was some minutes before she could advance another step she beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature she saw a large well proportioned apartment an handsome dimity bed arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid s care a bright bath stove mahogany wardrobes and neatly painted chairs on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows catherine had expected to have her feelings worked and worked they were astonishment and doubt first seized them and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame she could not be mistaken as to the room but how grossly mistaken in everything else in miss tilney s meaning in her own calculation this apartment to which she had given a date so ancient a position so awful proved to be one end of what the general s father had built there were two other doors in the chamber leading probably into dressing closets but she had no inclination to open either would the veil in which mrs tilney had last walked or the volume in which she had last read remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper no whatever might have been the general s crimes he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection she was sick of exploring and desired but to be safe in her own room with her own heart only privy to its folly and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered when the sound of footsteps she could hardly tell where made her pause and tremble to be found there even by a servant would be unpleasant but by the general and he seemed always at hand when least wanted much worse she listened the sound had ceased and resolving not to lose a moment she passed through and closed the door at that instant a door underneath was hastily opened someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery she had no power to move with a feeling of terror not very definable she fixed her eyes on the staircase and in a few moments it gave henry to her view mr tilney she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment he looked astonished too good god she continued not attending to his address how came you here how came you up that staircase how came i up that staircase he replied greatly surprised because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it catherine recollected herself blushed deeply and could say no more he seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford she moved on towards the gallery and may i not in my turn said he as he pushed back the folding doors ask how _ you _ came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine i have been said catherine looking down to see your mother s room my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till to morrow i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only dropping her voice your father was with us and that prevented you said henry earnestly regarding her have you looked into all the rooms in that passage no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress it is only a quarter past four showing his watch and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough she could not contradict it and therefore suffered herself to be detained though her dread of further questions made her for the first time in their acquaintance wish to leave him they walked slowly up the gallery have you had any letter from bath since i saw you no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose no it has been your own doing entirely catherine said nothing after a short silence during which he had closely observed her he added as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly slowly and with hesitation it was spoken and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her and from these circumstances he replied his quick eye fixed on hers you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some involuntarily she shook her head or it may be of something still less pardonable she raised her eyes towards him more fully than she had ever done before my mother s illness he continued the seizure which ended in her death _ was _ sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i _ we _ were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin but your father said catherine was _ he _ afflicted for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death i am very glad of it said catherine it would have been very shocking if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting they had reached the end of the gallery and with tears of shame she ran off to her own room chapter 25 the visions of romance were over catherine was completely awakened henry s address short as it had been had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done most grievously was she humbled most bitterly did she cry it was not only with herself that she was sunk but with henry her folly which now seemed even criminal was all exposed to him and he must despise her forever the liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father could he ever forgive it the absurdity of her curiosity and her fears could they ever be forgotten she hated herself more than she could express he had she thought he had once or twice before this fatal morning shown something like affection for her but now in short she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour went down when the clock struck five with a broken heart and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to eleanor s inquiry if she was well the formidable henry soon followed her into the room and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual catherine had never wanted comfort more and he looked as if he was aware of it the evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity she did not learn either to forget or defend the past but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther and that it might not cost her henry s entire regard her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary self created delusion each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which before she entered the abbey had been craving to be frightened she remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a knowledge of northanger she saw that the infatuation had been created the mischief settled long before her quitting bath and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged charming as were all mrs radcliffe s works and charming even as were the works of all her imitators it was not in them perhaps that human nature at least in the midland counties of england was to be looked for of the alps and pyrenees with their pine forests and their vices they might give a faithful delineation and italy switzerland and the south of france might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there represented catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country and even of that if hard pressed would have yielded the northern and western extremities but in the central part of england there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved in the laws of the land and the manners of the age murder was not tolerated servants were not slaves and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured like rhubarb from every druggist among the alps and pyrenees perhaps there were no mixed characters there such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend but in england it was not so among the english she believed in their hearts and habits there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad upon this conviction she would not be surprised if even in henry and eleanor tilney some slight imperfection might hereafter appear and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father who though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained she did believe upon serious consideration to be not perfectly amiable her mind made up on these several points and her resolution formed of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day henry s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed was of the greatest assistance to her and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress her spirits became absolutely comfortable and capable as heretofore of continual improvement by anything he said there were still some subjects indeed under which she believed they must always tremble the mention of a chest or a cabinet for instance and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape but even _ she _ could allow that an occasional memento of past folly however painful might not be without use the anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance her desire of hearing from isabella grew every day greater she was quite impatient to know how the bath world went on and how the rooms were attended and especially was she anxious to be assured of isabella s having matched some fine netting cotton on which she had left her intent and of her continuing on the best terms with james her only dependence for information of any kind was on isabella james had protested against writing to her till his return to oxford and mrs allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to fullerton but isabella had promised and promised again and when she promised a thing she was so scrupulous in performing it this made it so particularly strange for nine successive mornings catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment which each morning became more severe but on the tenth when she entered the breakfast room her first object was a letter held out by henry s willing hand she thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself tis only from james however as she looked at the direction she opened it it was from oxford and to this purpose dear catherine though god knows with little inclination for writing i think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between miss thorpe and me i left her and bath yesterday never to see either again i shall not enter into particulars they would only pain you more you will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame and i hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned thank god i am undeceived in time but it is a heavy blow after my father s consent had been so kindly given but no more of this she has made me miserable forever let me soon hear from you dear catherine you are my only friend _ your _ love i do build upon i wish your visit at northanger may be over before captain tilney makes his engagement known or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced poor thorpe is in town i dread the sight of him his honest heart would feel so much i have written to him and my father her duplicity hurts me more than all till the very last if i reasoned with her she declared herself as much attached to me as ever and laughed at my fears i am ashamed to think how long i bore with it but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved i was that man i cannot understand even now what she would be at for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of tilney we parted at last by mutual consent happy for me had we never met i can never expect to know such another woman dearest catherine beware how you give your heart believe me c catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of countenance and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder declared her to be receiving unpleasant news and henry earnestly watching her through the whole letter saw plainly that it ended no better than it began he was prevented however from even looking his surprise by his father s entrance they went to breakfast directly but catherine could hardly eat anything tears filled her eyes and even ran down her cheeks as she sat the letter was one moment in her hand then in her lap and then in her pocket and she looked as if she knew not what she did the general between his cocoa and his newspaper had luckily no leisure for noticing her but to the other two her distress was equally visible as soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room but the housemaids were busy in it and she was obliged to come down again she turned into the drawing room for privacy but henry and eleanor had likewise retreated thither and were at that moment deep in consultation about her she drew back trying to beg their pardon but was with gentle violence forced to return and the others withdrew after eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her after half an hour s free indulgence of grief and reflection catherine felt equal to encountering her friends but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration perhaps if particularly questioned she might just give an idea just distantly hint at it but not more to expose a friend such a friend as isabella had been to her and then their own brother so closely concerned in it she believed she must waive the subject altogether henry and eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast room and each as she entered it looked at her anxiously catherine took her place at the table and after a short silence eleanor said no bad news from fullerton i hope mr and mrs morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill no i thank you sighing as she spoke they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford nothing further was said for a few minutes and then speaking through her tears she added i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again i am sorry said henry closing the book he had just opened if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister replied henry warmly must be a comfort to him under any distress i have one favour to beg said catherine shortly afterwards in an agitated manner that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away our brother frederick yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney eleanor s work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment but henry began to suspect the truth and something in which miss thorpe s name was included passed his lips how quick you are cried catherine you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder _ now _ i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part recollecting with a blush the last line will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother no read it yourself cried catherine whose second thoughts were clearer i do not know what i was thinking of blushing again that she had blushed before james only means to give me good advice he gladly received the letter and having read it through with close attention returned it saying well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son miss tilney at catherine s invitation now read the letter likewise and having expressed also her concern and surprise began to inquire into miss thorpe s connections and fortune her mother is a very good sort of woman was catherine s answer what was her father a lawyer i believe they live at putney are they a wealthy family no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children the brother and sister looked at each other but said eleanor after a short pause would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry such a girl she must be an unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange an infatuation on frederick s side a girl who before his eyes is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man is not it inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly who found no woman good enough to be loved that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise such a sister in law henry i should delight in said eleanor with a smile but perhaps observed catherine though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant indeed i am afraid she will replied henry i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before among all the great variety that you have known and studied my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this no said catherine after a few moments reflection i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves catherine by some chance or other found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on though so unaccountably to mention the circumstance which had produced it chapter 26 from this time the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people and catherine found with some surprise that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering isabella s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother their persuasion that the general would upon this ground alone independent of the objection that might be raised against her character oppose the connection turned her feelings moreover with some alarm towards herself she was as insignificant and perhaps as portionless as isabella and if the heir of the tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest the very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality which as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money which she had more than once heard him utter and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children they were so fully convinced however that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person for his father s consent and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to come to northanger than at the present time that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own but as it was not to be supposed that captain tilney whenever he made his application would give his father any just idea of isabella s conduct it occurred to her as highly expedient that henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was enabling the general by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations she proposed it to him accordingly but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected no said he my father s hands need not be strengthened and frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled he must tell his own story but he will tell only half of it a quarter would be enough a day or two passed away and brought no tidings of captain tilney his brother and sister knew not what to think sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it the general meanwhile though offended every morning by frederick s remissness in writing was free from any real anxiety about him and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making miss morland s time at northanger pass pleasantly he often expressed his uneasiness on this head feared the sameness of every day s society and employments would disgust her with the place wished the lady frasers had been in the country talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood but then it was such a dead time of year no wild fowl no game and the lady frasers were not in the country and it all ended at last in his telling henry one morning that when he next went to woodston they would take him by surprise there some day or other and eat their mutton with him henry was greatly honoured and very happy and catherine was quite delighted with the scheme and when do you think sir i may look forward to this pleasure i must be at woodston on monday to attend the parish meeting and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us a ball itself could not have been more welcome to catherine than this little excursion so strong was her desire to be acquainted with woodston and her heart was still bounding with joy when henry about an hour afterwards came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and eleanor were sitting and said i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woodston on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it go away said catherine with a very long face and why why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure oh not seriously aye and sadly too for i had much rather stay but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because _ anything _ would do henry only smiled i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as to morrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return he went and it being at any time a much simpler operation to catherine to doubt her own judgment than henry s she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right however disagreeable to her his going but the inexplicability of the general s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts that he was very particular in his eating she had by her own unassisted observation already discovered but why he should say one thing so positively and mean another all the while was most unaccountable how were people at that rate to be understood who but henry could have been aware of what his father was at from saturday to wednesday however they were now to be without henry this was the sad finale of every reflection and captain tilney s letter would certainly come in his absence and wednesday she was very sure would be wet the past present and future were all equally in gloom her brother so unhappy and her loss in isabella so great and eleanor s spirits always affected by henry s absence what was there to interest or amuse her she was tired of the woods and the shrubberies always so smooth and so dry and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house the painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a consideration of the building what a revolution in her ideas she who had so longed to be in an abbey now there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well connected parsonage something like fullerton but better fullerton had its faults but woodston probably had none if wednesday should ever come it did come and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for it came it was fine and catherine trod on air by ten o clock the chaise and four conveyed the trio from the abbey and after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles they entered woodston a large and populous village in a situation not unpleasant catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it as the general seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country and the size of the village but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage and at all the little chandler s shops which they passed at the further end of the village and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it stood the parsonage a new built substantial stone house with its semicircular sweep and green gates and as they drove up to the door henry with the friends of his solitude a large newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers was ready to receive and make much of them catherine s mind was too full as she entered the house for her either to observe or to say a great deal and till called on by the general for her opinion of it she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting upon looking round it then she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world but she was too guarded to say so and the coldness of her praise disappointed him we are not calling it a good house said he we are not comparing it with fullerton and northanger we are considering it as a mere parsonage small and confined we allow but decent perhaps and habitable and altogether not inferior to the generality or in other words i believe there are few country parsonages in england half so good it may admit of improvement however far be it from me to say otherwise and anything in reason a bow thrown out perhaps though between ourselves if there is one thing more than another my aversion it is a patched on bow catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by henry at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant the general was shortly restored to his complacency and catherine to all her usual ease of spirits the room in question was of a commodious well proportioned size and handsomely fitted up as a dining parlour and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds she was shown first into a smaller apartment belonging peculiarly to the master of the house and made unusually tidy on the occasion and afterwards into what was to be the drawing room with the appearance of which though unfurnished catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general it was a prettily shaped room the windows reaching to the ground and the view from them pleasant though only over green meadows and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world i trust said the general with a most satisfied smile that it will very speedily be furnished it waits only for a lady s taste well if it was my house i should never sit anywhere else oh what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees too it is the prettiest cottage you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains such a compliment recalled all catherine s consciousness and silenced her directly and though pointedly applied to by the general for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her the influence of fresh objects and fresh air however was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations and having reached the ornamental part of the premises consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow on which henry s genius had begun to act about half a year ago she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure ground she had ever been in before though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner a saunter into other meadows and through part of the village with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about brought them to four o clock when catherine scarcely thought it could be three at four they were to dine and at six to set off on their return never had any day passed so quickly she could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the general nay that he was even looking at the side table for cold meat which was not there his son and daughter s observations were of a different kind they had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter s being oiled at six o clock the general having taken his coffee the carriage again received them and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations that could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son catherine would have quitted woodston with little anxiety as to the how or the when she might return to it chapter 27 the next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from isabella _ bath april _ my dearest catherine i received your two kind letters with the greatest delight and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner i really am quite ashamed of my idleness but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing i have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left bath but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other pray write to me soon and direct to my own home thank god we leave this vile place to morrow since you went away i have had no pleasure in it the dust is beyond anything and everybody one cares for is gone i believe if i could see you i should not mind the rest for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive i am quite uneasy about your dear brother not having heard from him since he went to oxford and am fearful of some misunderstanding your kind offices will set all right he is the only man i ever did or could love and i trust you will convince him of it the spring fashions are partly down and the hats the most frightful you can imagine i hope you spend your time pleasantly but am afraid you never think of me i will not say all that i could of the family you are with because i would not be ungenerous or set you against those you esteem but it is very difficult to know whom to trust and young men never know their minds two days together i rejoice to say that the young man whom of all others i particularly abhor has left bath you will know from this description i must mean captain tilney who as you may remember was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me before you went away afterwards he got worse and became quite my shadow many girls might have been taken in for never were such attentions but i knew the fickle sex too well he went away to his regiment two days ago and i trust i shall never be plagued with him again he is the greatest coxcomb i ever saw and amazingly disagreeable the last two days he was always by the side of charlotte davis i pitied his taste but took no notice of him the last time we met was in bath street and i turned directly into a shop that he might not speak to me i would not even look at him he went into the pump room afterwards but i would not have followed him for all the world such a contrast between him and your brother pray send me some news of the latter i am quite unhappy about him he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away with a cold or something that affected his spirits i would write to him myself but have mislaid his direction and as i hinted above am afraid he took something in my conduct amiss pray explain everything to his satisfaction or if he still harbours any doubt a line from himself to me or a call at putney when next in town might set all to rights i have not been to the rooms this age nor to the play except going in last night with the hodges for a frolic at half price they teased me into it and i was determined they should not say i shut myself up because tilney was gone we happened to sit by the mitchells and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out i knew their spite at one time they could not be civil to me but now they are all friendship but i am not such a fool as to be taken in by them you know i have a pretty good spirit of my own anne mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine as i wore it the week before at the concert but made wretched work of it it happened to become my odd face i believe at least tilney told me so at the time and said every eye was upon me but he is the last man whose word i would take i wear nothing but purple now i know i look hideous in it but no matter it is your dear brother s favourite colour lose no time my dearest sweetest catherine in writing to him and to me who ever am etc such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon catherine its inconsistencies contradictions and falsehood struck her from the very first she was ashamed of isabella and ashamed of having ever loved her her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty and her demands impudent write to james on her behalf no james should never hear isabella s name mentioned by her again on henry s arrival from woodston she made known to him and eleanor their brother s safety congratulating them with sincerity on it and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation when she had finished it so much for isabella she cried and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her it will soon be as if you never had said henry there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her i am persuaded that he never did and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake henry bowed his assent well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment it is very right that you should stand by your brother and if you would stand by _ yours _ you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge catherine was complimented out of further bitterness frederick could not be unpardonably guilty while henry made himself so agreeable she resolved on not answering isabella s letter and tried to think no more of it chapter 28 soon after this the general found himself obliged to go to london for a week and he left northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity should rob him even for an hour of miss morland s company and anxiously recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children as their chief object in his absence his departure gave catherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain the happiness with which their time now passed every employment voluntary every laugh indulged every meal a scene of ease and good humour walking where they liked and when they liked their hours pleasures and fatigues at their own command made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the general s presence had imposed and most thankfully feel their present release from it such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy but she was now in the fourth week of her visit before the general came home the fourth week would be turned and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer this was a painful consideration whenever it occurred and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind she very soon resolved to speak to eleanor about it at once propose going away and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken aware that if she gave herself much time she might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone with eleanor and of eleanor s being in the middle of a speech about something very different to start forth her obligation of going away very soon eleanor looked and declared herself much concerned she had hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time had been misled perhaps by her wishes to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised and could not but think that if mr and mrs morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there they would be too generous to hasten her return catherine explained oh as to _ that _ papa and mamma were in no hurry at all as long as she was happy they would always be satisfied then why might she ask in such a hurry herself to leave them oh because she had been there so long nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again and it was directly settled that till she had her leaving them was not even to be thought of in having this cause of uneasiness so pleasantly removed the force of the other was likewise weakened the kindness the earnestness of eleanor s manner in pressing her to stay and henry s gratified look on being told that her stay was determined were such sweet proofs of her importance with them as left her only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without she did almost always believe that henry loved her and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them and believing so far her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations henry was not able to obey his father s injunction of remaining wholly at northanger in attendance on the ladies during his absence in london the engagements of his curate at woodston obliging him to leave them on saturday for a couple of nights his loss was not now what it had been while the general was at home it lessened their gaiety but did not ruin their comfort and the two girls agreeing in occupation and improving in intimacy found themselves so well sufficient for the time to themselves that it was eleven o clock rather a late hour at the abbey before they quitted the supper room on the day of henry s departure they had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge that a carriage was driving up to the door and the next moment confirmed the idea by the loud noise of the house bell after the first perturbation of surprise had passed away in a good heaven what can be the matter it was quickly decided by eleanor to be her eldest brother whose arrival was often as sudden if not quite so unseasonable and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him catherine walked on to her chamber making up her mind as well as she could to a further acquaintance with captain tilney and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful she trusted he would never speak of miss thorpe and indeed as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted there could be no danger of it and as long as all mention of bath scenes were avoided she thought she could behave to him very civilly in such considerations time passed away and it was certainly in his favour that eleanor should be so glad to see him and have so much to say for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival and eleanor did not come up at that moment catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery and listened for its continuance but all was silent scarcely however had she convicted her fancy of error when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it she trembled a little at the idea of anyone s approaching so cautiously but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm or misled by a raised imagination she stepped quietly forward and opened the door eleanor and only eleanor stood there catherine s spirits however were tranquillized but for an instant for eleanor s cheeks were pale and her manner greatly agitated though evidently intending to come in it seemed an effort to enter the room and a still greater to speak when there catherine supposing some uneasiness on captain tilney s account could only express her concern by silent attention obliged her to be seated rubbed her temples with lavender water and hung over her with affectionate solicitude my dear catherine you must not you must not indeed were eleanor s first connected words i am quite well this kindness distracts me i cannot bear it i come to you on such an errand errand to me how shall i tell you oh how shall i tell you a new idea now darted into catherine s mind and turning as pale as her friend she exclaimed tis a messenger from woodston you are mistaken indeed returned eleanor looking at her most compassionately it is no one from woodston it is my father himself her voice faltered and her eyes were turned to the ground as she mentioned his name his unlooked for return was enough in itself to make catherine s heart sink and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told she said nothing and eleanor endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness but with eyes still cast down soon went on you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform i am indeed a most unwilling messenger after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by but i must not trust myself with words my dear catherine we are to part my father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on monday we are going to lord longtown s near hereford for a fortnight explanation and apology are equally impossible i cannot attempt either my dear eleanor cried catherine suppressing her feelings as well as she could do not be so distressed a second engagement must give way to a first i am very very sorry we are to part so soon and so suddenly too but i am not offended indeed i am not i can finish my visit here you know at any time or i hope you will come to me can you when you return from this lord s come to fullerton it will not be in my power catherine come when you can then eleanor made no answer and catherine s thoughts recurring to something more directly interesting she added thinking aloud monday so soon as monday and you _ all _ go well i am certain of i shall be able to take leave however i need not go till just before you do you know do not be distressed eleanor i can go on monday very well my father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence the general will send a servant with me i dare say half the way and then i shall soon be at salisbury and then i am only nine miles from home ah catherine were it settled so it would be somewhat less intolerable though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought but how can i tell you to morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice the very carriage is ordered and will be here at seven o clock and no servant will be offered you catherine sat down breathless and speechless i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can be more than i myself but i must not talk of what i felt oh that i could suggest anything in extenuation good god what will your father and mother say after courting you from the protection of real friends to this almost double distance from your home to have you driven out of the house without the considerations even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being the bearer of such a message i seem guilty myself of all its insult yet i trust you will acquit me for you must have been long enough in this house to see that i am but a nominal mistress of it that my real power is nothing have i offended the general said catherine in a faltering voice alas for my feelings as a daughter all that i know all that i answer for is that you can have given him no just cause of offence he certainly is greatly very greatly discomposed i have seldom seen him more so his temper is not happy and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree some disappointment some vexation which just at this moment seems important but which i can hardly suppose you to have any concern in for how is it possible it was with pain that catherine could speak at all and it was only for eleanor s sake that she attempted it i am sure said she i am very sorry if i have offended him it was the last thing i would willingly have done but do not be unhappy eleanor an engagement you know must be kept i am only sorry it was not recollected sooner that i might have written home but it is of very little consequence i hope i earnestly hope that to your real safety it will be of none but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to your family to the world were your friends the allens still in bath you might go to them with comparative ease a few hours would take you there but a journey of seventy miles to be taken post by you at your age alone unattended oh the journey is nothing do not think about that and if we are to part a few hours sooner or later you know makes no difference i can be ready by seven let me be called in time eleanor saw that she wished to be alone and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation now left her with i shall see you in the morning catherine s swelling heart needed relief in eleanor s presence friendship and pride had equally restrained her tears but no sooner was she gone than they burst forth in torrents turned from the house and in such a way without any reason that could justify any apology that could atone for the abruptness the rudeness nay the insolence of it henry at a distance not able even to bid him farewell every hope every expectation from him suspended at least and who could say how long who could say when they might meet again and all this by such a man as general tilney so polite so well bred and heretofore so particularly fond of her it was as incomprehensible as it was mortifying and grievous from what it could arise and where it would end were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm the manner in which it was done so grossly uncivil hurrying her away without any reference to her own convenience or allowing her even the appearance of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling of two days the earliest fixed on and of that almost the earliest hour as if resolved to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning that he might not be obliged even to see her what could all this mean but an intentional affront by some means or other she must have had the misfortune to offend him eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion but catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected or at least not supposed to be connected with it heavily passed the night sleep or repose that deserved the name of sleep was out of the question that room in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then how mournfully superior in reality and substance her anxiety had foundation in fact her fears in probability and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil the solitude of her situation the darkness of her chamber the antiquity of the building were felt and considered without the smallest emotion and though the wind was high and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house she heard it all as she lay awake hour after hour without curiosity or terror soon after six eleanor entered her room eager to show attention or give assistance where it was possible but very little remained to be done catherine had not loitered she was almost dressed and her packing almost finished the possibility of some conciliatory message from the general occurred to her as his daughter appeared what so natural as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it and she only wanted to know how far after what had passed an apology might properly be received by her but the knowledge would have been useless here it was not called for neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial eleanor brought no message very little passed between them on meeting each found her greatest safety in silence and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs catherine in busy agitation completing her dress and eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk when everything was done they left the room catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well known cherished object and went down to the breakfast parlour where breakfast was prepared she tried to eat as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable but she had no appetite and could not swallow many mouthfuls the contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery and strengthened her distaste for everything before her it was not four and twenty hours ago since they had met there to the same repast but in circumstances how different with what cheerful ease what happy though false security had she then looked around her enjoying everything present and fearing little in future beyond henry s going to woodston for a day happy happy breakfast for henry had been there henry had sat by her and helped her these reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion who sat as deep in thought as herself and the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the present moment catherine s colour rose at the sight of it and the indignity with which she was treated striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force made her for a short time sensible only of resentment eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech you _ must _ write to me catherine she cried you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour s comfort for _ one _ letter at all risks all hazards i must entreat let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at fullerton and have found your family well and then till i can ask for your correspondence as i ought to do i will not expect more direct to me at lord longtown s and i must ask it under cover to alice no eleanor if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me i am sure i had better not write there can be no doubt of my getting home safe eleanor only replied i cannot wonder at your feelings i will not importune you i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you but this with the look of sorrow accompanying it was enough to melt catherine s pride in a moment and she instantly said oh eleanor i _ will _ write to you indeed there was yet another point which miss tilney was anxious to settle though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of it had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey and upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation it proved to be exactly the case catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment but upon examining her purse was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together short however was that time the carriage was soon announced to be ready and catherine instantly rising a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu and as they entered the hall unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either she paused a moment and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left her kind remembrance for her absent friend but with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings and hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief she darted across the hall jumped into the chaise and in a moment was driven from the door chapter 29 catherine was too wretched to be fearful the journey in itself had no terrors for her and she began it without either dreading its length or feeling its solitariness leaning back in one corner of the carriage in a violent burst of tears she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it unfortunately the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from woodston and for fourteen miles every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different every mile as it brought her nearer woodston added to her sufferings and when within the distance of five she passed the turning which led to it and thought of henry so near yet so unconscious her grief and agitation were excessive the day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life it was there it was on that day that the general had made use of such expressions with regard to henry and herself had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage yes only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard had he even confused her by his too significant reference and now what had she done or what had she omitted to do to merit such a change the only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained and equally safe did she believe her secret with each designedly at least henry could not have betrayed her if indeed by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation if aware of her having viewed him as a murderer she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house but a justification so full of torture to herself she trusted would not be in his power anxious as were all her conjectures on this point it was not however the one on which she dwelt most there was a thought yet nearer a more prevailing more impetuous concern how henry would think and feel and look when he returned on the morrow to northanger and heard of her being gone was a question of force and interest to rise over every other to be never ceasing alternately irritating and soothing it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment to the general of course he would not dare to speak but to eleanor what might he not say to eleanor about her in this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries on any one article of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose the hours passed away and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for the pressing anxieties of thought which prevented her from noticing anything before her when once beyond the neighbourhood of woodston saved her at the same time from watching her progress and though no object on the road could engage a moment s attention she found no stage of it tedious from this she was preserved too by another cause by feeling no eagerness for her journey s conclusion for to return in such a manner to fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best even after an absence such as hers an eleven weeks absence what had she to say that would not humble herself and pain her family that would not increase her own grief by the confession of it extend an useless resentment and perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will she could never do justice to henry and eleanor s merit she felt it too strongly for expression and should a dislike be taken against them should they be thought of unfavourably on their father s account it would cut her to the heart with these feelings she rather dreaded than sought for the first view of that well known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of home salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving northanger but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it so great had been her ignorance of her route she met with nothing however to distress or frighten her her youth civil manners and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require and stopping only to change horses she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm and between six and seven o clock in the evening found herself entering fullerton a heroine returning at the close of her career to her native village in all the triumph of recovered reputation and all the dignity of a countess with a long train of noble relations in their several phaetons and three waiting maids in a travelling chaise and four behind her is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well delight to dwell it gives credit to every conclusion and the author must share in the glory she so liberally bestows but my affair is widely different i bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and disgrace and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness a heroine in a hack post chaise is such a blow upon sentiment as no attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand swiftly therefore shall her post boy drive through the village amid the gaze of sunday groups and speedy shall be her descent from it but whatever might be the distress of catherine s mind as she thus advanced towards the parsonage and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went first in the appearance of her carriage and secondly in herself the chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in fullerton the whole family were immediately at the window and to have it stop at the sweep gate was a pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy a pleasure quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children a boy and girl of six and four years old who expected a brother or sister in every carriage happy the glance that first distinguished catherine happy the voice that proclaimed the discovery but whether such happiness were the lawful property of george or harriet could never be exactly understood her father mother sarah george and harriet all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness was a sight to awaken the best feelings of catherine s heart and in the embrace of each as she stepped from the carriage she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible so surrounded so caressed she was even happy in the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was subdued and the pleasure of seeing her leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity they were all seated round the tea table which mrs morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice before any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her reluctantly and with much hesitation did she then begin what might perhaps at the end of half an hour be termed by the courtesy of her hearers an explanation but scarcely within that time could they at all discover the cause or collect the particulars of her sudden return they were far from being an irritable race far from any quickness in catching or bitterness in resenting affronts but here when the whole was unfolded was an insult not to be overlooked nor for the first half hour to be easily pardoned without suffering any romantic alarm in the consideration of their daughter s long and lonely journey mr and mrs morland could not but feel that it might have been productive of much unpleasantness to her that it was what they could never have voluntarily suffered and that in forcing her on such a measure general tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly neither as a gentleman nor as a parent why he had done it what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as catherine herself but it did not oppress them by any means so long and after a due course of useless conjecture that it was a strange business and that he must be a very strange man grew enough for all their indignation and wonder though sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour my dear you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble said her mother at last depend upon it it is something not at all worth understanding i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement said sarah but why not do it civilly i am sorry for the young people returned mrs morland they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney catherine sighed well continued her philosophic mother i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets catherine hoped so too and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment but her spirits were quite worn down and to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish she readily agreed to her mother s next counsel of going early to bed her parents seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away and though when they all met the next morning her recovery was not equal to their hopes they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil they never once thought of her heart which for the parents of a young lady of seventeen just returned from her first excursion from home was odd enough as soon as breakfast was over she sat down to fulfil her promise to miss tilney whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend s disposition was already justified for already did catherine reproach herself with having parted from eleanor coldly with having never enough valued her merits or kindness and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure the strength of these feelings however was far from assisting her pen and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing eleanor tilney to compose a letter which might at once do justice to her sentiments and her situation convey gratitude without servile regret be guarded without coldness and honest without resentment a letter which eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of and above all which she might not blush herself if henry should chance to see was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance and after long thought and much perplexity to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety the money therefore which eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart this has been a strange acquaintance observed mrs morland as the letter was finished soon made and soon ended i am sorry it happens so for mrs allen thought them very pretty kind of young people and you were sadly out of luck too in your isabella ah poor james well we must live and learn and the next new friends you make i hope will be better worth keeping catherine coloured as she warmly answered no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor if so my dear i dare say you will meet again some time or other do not be uneasy it is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years and then what a pleasure it will be mrs morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation the hope of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into catherine s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting dreadful to her she could never forget henry tilney or think of him with less tenderness than she did at that moment but he might forget her and in that case to meet her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed and her mother perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect proposed as another expedient for restoring her spirits that they should call on mrs allen the two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart and as they walked mrs morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of james s disappointment we are sorry for him said she but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with and who was so entirely without fortune and now after such behaviour we cannot think at all well of her just at present it comes hard to poor james but that will not last forever and i dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life for the foolishness of his first choice this was just such a summary view of the affair as catherine could listen to another sentence might have endangered her complaisance and made her reply less rational for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well known road it was not three months ago since wild with joyful expectation she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day with an heart light gay and independent looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it three months ago had seen her all this and now how altered a being did she return she was received by the allens with all the kindness which her unlooked for appearance acting on a steady affection would naturally call forth and great was their surprise and warm their displeasure on hearing how she had been treated though mrs morland s account of it was no inflated representation no studied appeal to their passions catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening said she she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself mr allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend and mrs allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself his wonder his conjectures and his explanations became in succession hers with the addition of this single remark i really have not patience with the general to fill up every accidental pause and i really have not patience with the general was uttered twice after mr allen left the room without any relaxation of anger or any material digression of thought a more considerable degree of wandering attended the third repetition and after completing the fourth she immediately added only think my dear of my having got that frightful great rent in my best mechlin so charmingly mended before i left bath that one can hardly see where it was i must show it you some day or other bath is a nice place catherine after all i assure you i did not above half like coming away mrs thorpe s being there was such a comfort to us was not it you know you and i were quite forlorn at first yes but _ that _ did not last long said catherine her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there very true we soon met with mrs thorpe and then we wanted for nothing my dear do not you think these silk gloves wear very well i put them on new the first time of our going to the lower rooms you know and i have worn them a great deal since do you remember that evening do i oh perfectly it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on catherine could not answer and after a short trial of other subjects mrs allen again returned to i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know as they walked home again mrs morland endeavoured to impress on her daughter s mind the happiness of having such steady well wishers as mr and mrs allen and the very little consideration which the neglect or unkindness of slight acquaintance like the tilneys ought to have with her while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her earliest friends there was a great deal of good sense in all this but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power and catherine s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced it was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended and while mrs morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations catherine was silently reflecting that _ now _ henry must have arrived at northanger _ now _ he must have heard of her departure and _ now _ perhaps they were all setting off for hereford chapter 30 catherine s disposition was not naturally sedentary nor had her habits been ever very industrious but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased she could neither sit still nor employ herself for ten minutes together walking round the garden and orchard again and again as if nothing but motion was voluntary and it seemed as if she could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time in the parlour her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration in her rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself but in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she had been before for two days mrs morland allowed it to pass even without a hint but when a third night s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness improved her in useful activity nor given her a greater inclination for needlework she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful catherine took up her work directly saying in a dejected voice that her head did not run upon bath much then you are fretting about general tilney and that is very simple of you for ten to one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles after a short silence i hope my catherine you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as northanger that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat there is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance the mirror i think i will look it out for you some day or other because i am sure it will do you good catherine said no more and with an endeavour to do right applied to her work but after a few minutes sunk again without knowing it herself into languor and listlessness moving herself in her chair from the irritation of weariness much oftener than she moved her needle mrs morland watched the progress of this relapse and seeing in her daughter s absent and dissatisfied look the full proof of that repining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of cheerfulness hastily left the room to fetch the book in question anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady it was some time before she could find what she looked for and other family matters occurring to detain her a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes till on entering the room the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before with a look of much respect he immediately rose and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as mr henry tilney with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for his appearance there acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at fullerton and stating his impatience to be assured of miss morland s having reached her home in safety as the cause of his intrusion he did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart far from comprehending him or his sister in their father s misconduct mrs morland had been always kindly disposed towards each and instantly pleased by his appearance received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence thanking him for such an attention to her daughter assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there and entreating him to say not another word of the past he was not ill inclined to obey this request for though his heart was greatly relieved by such unlooked for mildness it was not just at that moment in his power to say anything to the purpose returning in silence to his seat therefore he remained for some minutes most civilly answering all mrs morland s common remarks about the weather and roads catherine meanwhile the anxious agitated happy feverish catherine said not a word but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of the mirror for a future hour desirous of mr morland s assistance as well in giving encouragement as in finding conversation for her guest whose embarrassment on his father s account she earnestly pitied mrs morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him but mr morland was from home and being thus without any support at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say after a couple of minutes unbroken silence henry turning to catherine for the first time since her mother s entrance asked her with sudden alacrity if mr and mrs allen were now at fullerton and on developing from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply the meaning which one short syllable would have given immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them and with a rising colour asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way you may see the house from this window sir was information on sarah s side which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman and a silencing nod from her mother for mrs morland thinking it probable as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours that he might have some explanation to give of his father s behaviour which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to catherine would not on any account prevent her accompanying him they began their walk and mrs morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it some explanation on his father s account he had to give but his first purpose was to explain himself and before they reached mr allen s grounds he had done it so well that catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often she was assured of his affection and that heart in return was solicited which perhaps they pretty equally knew was already entirely his own for though henry was now sincerely attached to her though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society i must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude or in other words that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought it is a new circumstance in romance i acknowledge and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine s dignity but if it be as new in common life the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own a very short visit to mrs allen in which henry talked at random without sense or connection and catherine wrapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness scarcely opened her lips dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tête à tête and before it was suffered to close she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application on his return from woodston two days before he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father hastily informed in angry terms of miss morland s departure and ordered to think of her no more such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand the affrighted catherine amidst all the terrors of expectation as she listened to this account could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject and as he proceeded to give the particulars and explain the motives of his father s conduct her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight the general had had nothing to accuse her of nothing to lay to her charge but her being the involuntary unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own she was guilty only of being less rich than he had supposed her to be under a mistaken persuasion of her possessions and claims he had courted her acquaintance in bath solicited her company at northanger and designed her for his daughter in law on discovering his error to turn her from the house seemed the best though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself and his contempt of her family john thorpe had first misled him the general perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to miss morland had accidentally inquired of thorpe if he knew more of her than her name thorpe most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of general tilney s importance had been joyfully and proudly communicative and being at that time not only in daily expectation of morland s engaging isabella but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying catherine himself his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them with whomsoever he was or was likely to be connected his own consequence always required that theirs should be great and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew so regularly grew their fortune the expectations of his friend morland therefore from the first overrated had ever since his introduction to isabella been gradually increasing and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment by doubling what he chose to think the amount of mr morland s preferment trebling his private fortune bestowing a rich aunt and sinking half the children he was able to represent the whole family to the general in a most respectable light for catherine however the peculiar object of the general s curiosity and his own speculations he had yet something more in reserve and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to mr allen s estate her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of fullerton naturally followed upon such intelligence the general had proceeded for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority thorpe s interest in the family by his sister s approaching connection with one of its members and his own views on another circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth and to these were added the absolute facts of the allens being wealthy and childless of miss morland s being under their care and as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge of their treating her with parental kindness his resolution was soon formed already had he discerned a liking towards miss morland in the countenance of his son and thankful for mr thorpe s communication he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this than his own children henry and eleanor perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father s particular respect had seen with astonishment the suddenness continuance and extent of his attention and though latterly from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her henry was convinced of his father s believing it to be an advantageous connection it was not till the late explanation at northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on that they were false the general had learnt from the very person who had suggested them from thorpe himself whom he had chanced to meet again in town and who under the influence of exactly opposite feelings irritated by catherine s refusal and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between morland and isabella convinced that they were separated forever and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the morlands confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families with the most liberal proposals he had on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support they were in fact a necessitous family numerous too almost beyond example by no means respected in their own neighbourhood as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections a forward bragging scheming race the terrified general pronounced the name of allen with an inquiring look and here too thorpe had learnt his error the allens he believed had lived near them too long and he knew the young man on whom the fullerton estate must devolve the general needed no more enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself he set out the next day for the abbey where his performances have been seen i leave it to my reader s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for henry to communicate at this time to catherine how much of it he could have learnt from his father in what points his own conjectures might assist him and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from james i have united for their ease what they must divide for mine catherine at any rate heard enough to feel that in suspecting general tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife she had scarcely sinned against his character or magnified his cruelty henry in having such things to relate of his father was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself he blushed for the narrow minded counsel which he was obliged to expose the conversation between them at northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind henry s indignation on hearing how catherine had been treated on comprehending his father s views and being ordered to acquiesce in them had been open and bold the general accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family prepared for no reluctance but of feeling no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words could ill brook the opposition of his son steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it but in such a cause his anger though it must shock could not intimidate henry who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice he felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to miss morland and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger could shake his fidelity or influence the resolutions it prompted he steadily refused to accompany his father into herefordshire an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of catherine and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand the general was furious in his anger and they parted in dreadful disagreement henry in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose had returned almost instantly to woodston and on the afternoon of the following day had begun his journey to fullerton chapter 31 mr and mrs morland s surprise on being applied to by mr tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was for a few minutes considerable it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side but as nothing after all could be more natural than catherine s being beloved they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride and as far as they alone were concerned had not a single objection to start his pleasing manners and good sense were self evident recommendations and having never heard evil of him it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told goodwill supplying the place of experience his character needed no attestation catherine would make a sad heedless young housekeeper to be sure was her mother s foreboding remark but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice there was but one obstacle in short to be mentioned but till that one was removed it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement their tempers were mild but their principles were steady and while his parent so expressly forbade the connection they could not allow themselves to encourage it that the general should come forward to solicit the alliance or that he should even very heartily approve it they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded and that once obtained and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied their willing approbation was instantly to follow his _ consent _ was all that they wished for they were no more inclined than entitled to demand his _ money _ of a very considerable fortune his son was by marriage settlements eventually secure his present income was an income of independence and comfort and under every pecuniary view it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter the young people could not be surprised at a decision like this they felt and they deplored but they could not resent it and they parted endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general as each believed almost impossible might speedily take place to unite them again in the fulness of privileged affection henry returned to what was now his only home to watch over his young plantations and extend his improvements for her sake to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward and catherine remained at fullerton to cry whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence let us not inquire mr and mrs morland never did they had been too kind to exact any promise and whenever catherine received a letter as at that time happened pretty often they always looked another way the anxiety which in this state of their attachment must be the portion of henry and catherine and of all who loved either as to its final event can hardly extend i fear to the bosom of my readers who will see in the tell tale compression of the pages before them that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity the means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the general s the circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence which took place in the course of the summer an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour from which he did not recover till after eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of henry and his permission for him to be a fool if he liked it the marriage of eleanor tilney her removal from all the evils of such a home as northanger had been made by henry s banishment to the home of her choice and the man of her choice is an event which i expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance my own joy on the occasion is very sincere i know no one more entitled by unpretending merit or better prepared by habitual suffering to receive and enjoy felicity her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her his unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties and never had the general loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship utility and patient endurance as when he first hailed her your ladyship her husband was really deserving of her independent of his peerage his wealth and his attachment being to a precision the most charming young man in the world any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary the most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination of us all concerning the one in question therefore i have only to add aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing bills resulting from a long visit at northanger by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures the influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of mr morland s circumstances which as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed they were qualified to give it taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by thorpe s first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor and that catherine would have three thousand pounds this was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence which he was at some pains to procure that the fullerton estate being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor was consequently open to every greedy speculation on the strength of this the general soon after eleanor s marriage permitted his son to return to northanger and thence made him the bearer of his consent very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to mr morland the event which it authorized soon followed henry and catherine were married the bells rang and everybody smiled and as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting it will not appear after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the general s cruelty that they were essentially hurt by it to begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty six and eighteen is to do pretty well and professing myself moreover convinced that the general s unjust interference so far from being really injurious to their felicity was perhaps rather conducive to it by improving their knowledge of each other and adding strength to their attachment i leave it to be settled by whomsoever it may concern whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny or reward filial disobedience \n",

            " emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister s marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr woodhouse s family less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma between _ them _ it was more the intimacy of sisters even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming miss taylor s judgment but directed chiefly by her own the real evils indeed of emma s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments the danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness miss taylor married it was miss taylor s loss which first brought grief it was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance the wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost the event had every promise of happiness for her friend mr weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black morning s work for her the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day she recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella s marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent well informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault how was she to bear the change it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs weston only half a mile from them and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her no equals the woodhouses were first in consequence there all looked up to them she had many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day it was a melancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful his spirits required support he was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter s marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner poor miss taylor i wish she were here again what a pity it is that mr weston ever thought of her i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot mr weston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us we shall be always meeting _ we _ must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance i could not walk half so far no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage to be sure the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you i am very glad i did think of her it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil pretty spoken girl i have a great opinion of her whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us he will be able to tell her how we all are emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own the backgammon table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary mr knightley a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabella s husband he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london he had returned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square it was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time mr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily when this was over mr woodhouse gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not catch cold dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding by the bye i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature said emma playfully that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by i believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse with a sigh i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome my dearest papa you do not think i could mean _ you _ or suppose mr knightley to mean _ you _ what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another mr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body emma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer well said emma willing to let it pass you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day dear emma bears every thing so well said her father but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she _ will _ miss her more than she thinks for emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion said mr knightley we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing mr knightley shook his head at her her father fondly replied ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know every body said that mr weston would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell s i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off match making i do not understand what you mean by success said mr knightley success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and _ that _ is all that can be said and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that a straightforward open hearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others rejoined mr woodhouse understanding but in part but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one s family circle grievously only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day that will be a much better thing i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr knightley laughing and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself chapter ii mr weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property he had received a good education but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortune though her fortune bore no proportion to the family estate was not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the infinite mortification of mr and mrs churchill who threw her off with due decorum it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness mrs weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother s unreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved the boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother s been the means of a sort of reconciliation and mr and mrs churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease some scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could a complete change of life became desirable he quitted the militia and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening it was a concern which brought just employment enough he had still a small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away he had by that time realised an easy competence enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it he had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was his own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle s heir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his father s assistance his father had no apprehension of it the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely but it was not in mr weston s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern mr frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved now upon his father s marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention that the visit should take place there was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when mrs perry drank tea with mrs and miss bates or when mrs and miss bates returned the visit now was the time for mr frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs weston had received i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written to mrs weston i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed mr woodhouse told me of it mr woodhouse saw the letter and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life it was indeed a highly prized letter mrs weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured she felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her she knew that at times she must be missed and could not think without pain of emma s losing a single pleasure or suffering an hour s ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield so convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr weston s disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs weston and of moments only of regret and her satisfaction her more than satisfaction her cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity poor miss taylor when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own but never did she go without mr woodhouse s giving a gentle sigh and saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay there was no recovering miss taylor nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr woodhouse the compliments of his neighbours were over he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event and the wedding cake which had been a great distress to him was all eat up his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be different from himself what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly tried to prevent any body s eating it he had been at the pains of consulting mr perry the apothecary on the subject mr perry was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr woodhouse s life and upon being applied to he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that wedding cake might certainly disagree with many perhaps with most people unless taken moderately with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs weston s wedding cake in their hands but mr woodhouse would never believe it chapter iii mr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner parties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley comprehended many such not unfrequently through emma s persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card table for him real long standing regard brought the westons and mr knightley and by mr elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr woodhouse s drawing room and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away after these came a second set among the most come at able of whom were mrs and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses had it taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance mrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness her youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible and yet she was a happy woman and a woman whom no one named without good will it was her own universal good will and contented temper which worked such wonders she loved every body was interested in every body s happiness quicksighted to every body s merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body and a mine of felicity to herself she was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip mrs goddard was the mistress of a school not of a seminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systems and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but a real honest old fashioned boarding school where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education without any danger of coming back prodigies mrs goddard s school was in high repute and very deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church she was a plain motherly kind of woman who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea visit and having formerly owed much to mr woodhouse s kindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancy work whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect and happy was she for her father s sake in the power though as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of mrs weston she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day a note was brought from mrs goddard requesting in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody somebody had placed her several years back at mrs goddard s school and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour boarder this was all that was generally known of her history she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired she was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith s conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement encouragement should be given those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her the friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort of people must be doing her harm they were a family of the name of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm of mr knightley and residing in the parish of donwell very creditably she believed she knew mr knightley thought highly of them but they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect _ she _ would notice her she would improve her she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good society she would form her opinions and her manners it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the in betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper table which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests upon such occasions poor mr woodhouse s feelings were in sad warfare he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough self approbation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a _ little _ bit of tart a _ very _ little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to _ half _ a glass of wine a _ small _ half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you emma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last chapter iv harriet smith s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing quick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other as a walking companion emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her in that respect mrs weston s loss had been important her father never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied and since mrs weston s marriage her exercise had been too much confined she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant and a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to her early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smith s being exactly the young friend she wanted exactly the something which her home required such a friend as mrs weston was out of the question two such could never be granted two such she did not want it was quite a different sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent mrs weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful for mrs weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents but harriet could not tell she was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain emma was obliged to fancy what she liked but she could never believe that in the same situation _ she _ should not have discovered the truth harriet had no penetration she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs goddard chose to tell her and looked no farther mrs goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversation and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey mill farm it must have been the whole but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place emma encouraged her talkativeness amused by such a picture of another set of beings and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs martin s having _ two _ parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard s drawing room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs martin s saying as she was so fond of it it should be called _ her _ cow and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter a son and son s wife who all lived together but when it appeared that the mr martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good nature in doing something or other was a single man that there was no young mrs martin no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin and there was evidently no dislike to it harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good humoured and obliging he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in every thing else he was so very obliging he had his shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her she was very fond of singing he could sing a little himself she believed he was very clever and understood every thing he had a very fine flock and while she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country she believed every body spoke well of him his mother and sisters were very fond of him mrs martin had told her one day and there was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he would make a good husband not that she _ wanted _ him to marry she was in no hurry at all well done mrs martin thought emma you know what you are about and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send mrs goddard a beautiful goose the finest goose mrs goddard had ever seen mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he reads all _ them _ to himself but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can the next question was what sort of looking man is mr martin oh not handsome not at all handsome i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now one does not you know after a time but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston he has passed you very often that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well what do you imagine his age to be he was four and twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day s difference which is very odd only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer s daughter without education to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no alarming symptoms of love the young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on harriet s side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own they met mr martin the very next day as they were walking on the donwell road he was on foot and after looking very respectfully at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin his appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriet s inclination harriet was not insensible of manner she had voluntarily noticed her father s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder mr martin looked as if he did not know what manner was they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not so genteel as real gentlemen i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man mr knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with _ him _ you might not see one in a hundred with _ gentleman _ so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of _ them _ compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference oh yes there is a great difference but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly but there may be pretty good guessing he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss will he indeed that will be very bad how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he _ will _ thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _ us _ i wonder he did not remember the book was all harriet s answer and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself she therefore said no more for some time her next beginning was in one respect perhaps mr elton s manners are superior to mr knightley s or mr weston s they have more gentleness they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in _ him _ because there is so much good humour with it but that would not do to be copied neither would mr knightley s downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits _ him _ very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model mr elton is good humoured cheerful obliging and gentle he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be if he means any thing it must be to please you did not i tell you what he said of you the other day she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from mr elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed and smiled and said she had always thought mr elton very agreeable mr elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet s head she thought it would be an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural and probable for her to have much merit in planning it she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict it was not likely however that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet s coming to hartfield the longer she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency mr elton s situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself and without low connexions at the same time not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet he had a comfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient income for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known to have some independent property and she thought very highly of him as a good humoured well meaning respectable young man without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on harriet s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy and he was really a very pleasing young man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general though not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr elton s admiration chapter v i do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston said mr knightley of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing a bad thing do you really think it a bad thing why so i think they will neither of them do the other any good you surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure how very differently we feel not think they will do each other any good this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma mr knightley perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle mr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject we were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life i can imagine your objection to harriet smith she is not the superior young woman which emma s friend ought to be but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself they will read together she means it i know emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through and very good lists they were very well chosen and very neatly arranged sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule the list she drew up when only fourteen i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished you know you could not i dare say replied mrs weston smiling that i thought so _ then _ but since we have parted i can never remember emma s omitting to do any thing i wished there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _ that _ said mr knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done but i he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her she inherits her mother s talents and must have been under subjection to her i should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on _ your _ recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouse s family and wanted another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held yes said he smiling you are better placed _ here _ very fit for a wife but not at all for a governess but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from _ her _ on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor thank you there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr weston why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne we will not despair however weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him i hope not _ that _ it is not likely no mr knightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter not i indeed i only name possibilities i do not pretend to emma s genius for foretelling and guessing i hope with all my heart the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune but harriet smith i have not half done about harriet smith i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned her ignorance is hourly flattery how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet i will venture to say that _ she _ cannot gain by the acquaintance hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home i am much mistaken if emma s doctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life they only give a little polish i either depend more upon emma s good sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance how well she looked last night oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you very well i shall not attempt to deny emma s being pretty pretty say beautiful rather can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether face and figure i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers but i am a partial old friend such an eye the true hazle eye and so brilliant regular features open countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance one hears sometimes of a child being the picture of health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown up health she is loveliness itself mr knightley is not she i have not a fault to find with her person he replied i think her all you describe i love to look at her and i will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way mrs weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm and i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm with all dear emma s little faults she is an excellent creature where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred times very well i will not plague you any more emma shall be an angel and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children i am sure of having their opinions with me i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr knightley at this little remains of office not at all cried he i am much obliged to you for it it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to mrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry i will keep my ill humour to myself i have a very sincere interest in emma isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one feels for emma i wonder what will become of her so do i said mrs weston gently very much she always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present said mrs weston as can well be and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr woodhouse s account i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr weston s on the subject as much as possible there were wishes at randalls respecting emma s destiny but it was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition which mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield chapter vi emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr elton s being a remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet s side as there could be any occasion for she was quite convinced of mr elton s being in the fairest way of falling in love if not in love already she had no scruple with regard to him he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add his perception of the striking improvement of harriet s manner since her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment you have given miss smith all that she required said he you have made her graceful and easy she was a beautiful creature when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself i have done very little if it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant mr elton i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before exactly so that is what principally strikes me so much superadded decision of character skilful has been the hand great has been the pleasure i am sure i never met with a disposition more truly amiable i have no doubt of it and it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover she was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have harriet s picture did you ever have your likeness taken harriet said she did you ever sit for your picture harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say with a very interesting naïveté oh dear no never no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would give any money for it i almost long to attempt her likeness myself you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me it would be such a delight to have her picture let me entreat you cried mr elton it would indeed be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend i know what your drawings are how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at randalls yes good man thought emma but what has all that to do with taking likenesses you know nothing of drawing don t pretend to be in raptures about mine keep your raptures for harriet s face well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe i shall try what i can do harriet s features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch exactly so the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth i have not a doubt of your success pray pray attempt it as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit she thinks so little of her own beauty did not you observe her manner of answering me how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn oh yes i observed it i assure you it was not lost on me but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others emma wished to go to work directly and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits for not one of them had ever been hed that they might decide together on the best size for harriet her many beginnings were displayed miniatures half lengths whole lengths pencil crayon and water colours had been all tried in turn she had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to she played and sang and drew in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved there was merit in every drawing in the least hed perhaps the most her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same they were both in ecstasies a likeness pleases every body and miss woodhouse s performances must be capital no great variety of faces for you said emma i had only my own family to study from there is my father another of my father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore mrs weston again and again and again you see dear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion she would sit whenever i asked her there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet then here come all my attempts at three of those four children there they are henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mama s children ever were here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see he had nestled down his head most conveniently that s very like i am rather proud of little george the corner of the sofa is very good then here is my last unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size whole length my last and my best my brother mr john knightley this did not want much of being hed when i put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i had really made a very good likeness of it mrs weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it _ very _ like only too handsome too flattering but that was a fault on the right side after all this came poor dear isabella s cold approbation of yes it was a little like but to be sure it did not do him justice we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i could bear and so i never would h it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in brunswick square and as i said i did then forswear ever drawing any body again but for harriet s sake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _ at _ _ present _ i will break my resolution now mr elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe exactly so no husbands and wives with so interesting a consciousness that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once but as she wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait it was to be a whole length in water colours like mr john knightley s and was destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece the sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist but there was no doing any thing with mr elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence but was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to place himself elsewhere it then occurred to her to employ him in reading if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness indeed it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the irksomeness of miss smith s mr elton was only too happy harriet listened and emma drew in peace she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress and be charmed there was no being displeased with such an encourager for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible she could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable the sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on there was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure to give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both a standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations as mr elton s very promising attachment was likely to add harriet was to sit again the next day and mr elton just as he ought entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again by all means we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress of the picture which was rapid and happy every body who saw it was pleased but mr elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every criticism miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted observed mrs weston to him not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover the expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes it is the fault of her face that she has them not do you think so replied he i cannot agree with you it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature i never saw such a likeness in my life we must allow for the effect of shade you know you have made her too tall emma said mr knightley emma knew that she had but would not own it and mr elton warmly added oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know proportions fore shortening oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s exactly so indeed it is very pretty said mr woodhouse so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear i do not know any body who draws so well as you do the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear you sir may say any thing cried mr elton but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character the naïveté of miss smith s manners and altogether oh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such a likeness the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a few difficulties it must be done directly it must be done in london the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions must not be applied to because it was december and mr woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december but no sooner was the distress known to mr elton than it was removed his gallantry was always on the alert might he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it he could ride to london at any time it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand he was too good she could not endure the thought she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances and a very few minutes settled the business mr elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame and give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough what a precious deposit said he with a tender sigh as he received it this man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma i should say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love he is an excellent young man and will suit harriet exactly it will be an exactly so as he says himself but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal i come in for a pretty good share as a second but it is his gratitude on harriet s account chapter vii the very day of mr elton s going to london produced a fresh occasion for emma s services towards her friend harriet had been at hartfield as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell half a minute brought it all out she had heard as soon as she got back to mrs goddard s that mr martin had been there an hour before and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself and this letter was from him from mr martin and contained a direct proposal of marriage who could have thought it she was so surprized she did not know what to do yes quite a proposal of marriage and a very good letter at least she thought so and he wrote as if he really loved her very much but she did not know and so she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do emma was half ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can will you read the letter cried harriet pray do ii d rather you would emma was not sorry to be pressed she read and was surprized the style of the letter was much above her expectation there were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer it was short but expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling she paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion with a well well and was at last forced to add is it a good letter or is it too short yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowly so good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words it is so with some men yes i understand the sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse a better written letter harriet returning it than i had expected well said the still waiting harriet well and and what shall i do what shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard to this letter yes but what are you in doubt of you must answer it of course and speedily yes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me oh no no the letter had much better be all your own you will express yourself very properly i am sure there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing your meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to _ your _ mind i am persuaded you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment you think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you in any doubt as to that i thought but i beg your pardon perhaps i have been under a mistake i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the _ purport _ of your answer i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it harriet was silent with a little reserve of manner emma continued you mean to return a favourable answer i collect no i do not that is i do not mean what shall i do what would you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do i shall not give you any advice harriet i will have nothing to do with it this is a point which you must settle with your feelings i had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet contemplating the letter for a little while emma persevered in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman _ doubts _ as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say no directly it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you but do not imagine that i want to influence you oh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to but if you would just advise me what i had best do no no i do not mean that as you say one s mind ought to be quite made up one should not be hesitating it is a very serious thing it will be safer to say no perhaps do you think i had better say no not for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise you either way you must be the best judge of your own happiness if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate you blush harriet does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion at this moment whom are you thinking of the symptoms were favourable instead of answering harriet turned away confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though the letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted about without regard emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes at last with some hesitation harriet said miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin do you think i am right perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving dear harriet i give myself joy of this it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr martin while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbey mill farm now i am secure of you for ever harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck her forcibly you could not have visited me she cried looking aghast no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all good society i must have given you up dear me how should i ever have borne it it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more dear affectionate creature _ you _ banished to abbey mill farm _ you _ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it he must have a pretty good opinion of himself i do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet her conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard for but that is quite a different thing from and you know though he may like me it does not follow that i should and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all _ one _ is so very handsome and agreeable however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration thank you thank you my own sweet little friend we will not be parted a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter oh no and it is but a short letter too emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that her husband could write a good letter oh yes very nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions i am quite determined to refuse him but how shall i do what shall i say emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence the looking over his letter again in replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all this letter however was written and sealed and sent the business was hed and harriet safe she was rather low all the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr elton i shall never be invited to abbey mill again was said in rather a sorrowful tone nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield some time afterwards it was i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss nash would for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linen draper one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that people should like her so much the idea of mr elton was certainly cheering but still after a time she was tender hearted again towards the rejected mr martin now he has got my letter said she softly i wonder what they are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too i hope he will not mind it so very much let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed cried emma at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name my picture but he has left my picture in bond street has he so then i know nothing of mr elton no my dear little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger chapter viii harriet slept at hartfield that night for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to have a bed room appropriated to herself and emma judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible just at present she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs goddard s but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield to make a regular visit of some days while she was gone mr knightley called and sat some time with mr woodhouse and emma till mr woodhouse who had previously made up his mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it and was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples of his own civility to leave mr knightley for that purpose mr knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other well i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take emma s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour as the sun is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can i treat you without ceremony mr knightley we invalids think we are privileged people my dear sir do not make a stranger of me i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter emma will be happy to entertain you and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns my winter walk you cannot do better sir i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i think the sooner _ you _ go the better i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you mr woodhouse at last was off but mr knightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat he began speaking of harriet and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before i cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting come said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you that you have improved her you have cured her of her school girl s giggle she really does you credit thank you i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may _ you _ do not often overpower me with it you are expecting her again you say this morning almost every moment she has been gone longer already than she intended something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps highbury gossips tiresome wretches harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said nothing he presently added with a smile i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage indeed how so of what sort a very serious sort i assure you still smiling very serious i can think of but one thing who is in love with her who makes you their confidant emma was more than half in hopes of mr elton s having dropt a hint mr knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew mr elton looked up to him i have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter robert martin is the man her visit to abbey mill this summer seems to have done his business he is desperately in love and means to marry her he is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet means to marry him well well means to make her an offer then will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since _ your _ making so much of her as in a line of society above him i was very much pleased with all that he said i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage he is an excellent young man both as son and brother i had no hesitation in advising him to marry he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had this happened the night before last now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs goddard s to day and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch pray mr knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterday certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred was not she the whole day with you come said she i will tell you something in return for what you have told me he did speak yesterday that is he wrote and was refused this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed and mr knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood up in tall indignation and said then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her what is the foolish girl about oh to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her nonsense a man does not imagine any such thing but what is the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if it is so but i hope you are mistaken i saw her answer nothing could be clearer you saw her answer you wrote her answer too emma this is your doing you persuaded her to refuse him and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her by your account he does seem to have had some scruples it is a pity that they were ever got over not harriet s equal exclaimed mr knightley loudly and warmly and with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you what are harriet smith s claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations she is known only as parlour boarder at a common school she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck even _ your _ satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves is much above his it would be a degradation a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin whoever might be her parents said mr knightley whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it _ was _ good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do to be sure cried she playfully i know _ that _ is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said mr knightley presently though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my _ letting _ her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried mr knightley robert martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone she did not repent what she had done she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence with only one attempt on emma s side to talk of the weather but he made no answer he was thinking the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain emma laughed and disclaimed he continued depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself i have done with match making indeed i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave off while i am well good morning to you said he rising and walking off abruptly he was very much vexed he felt the disappointment of the young man and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly emma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her s than in his she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary s wrong as mr knightley he walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her she was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives harriet s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy the possibility of the young man s coming to mrs goddard s that morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits and without having any such reason to give for her long absence she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind and convinced her that let mr knightley think or say what he would she had done nothing which woman s friendship and woman s feelings would not justify he had frightened her a little about mr elton but when she considered that mr knightley could not have observed him as she had done neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of mr knightley s pretensions with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew any thing about he certainly might have heard mr elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and mr elton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them but then mr knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives mr knightley saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest and more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very sure did not belong to mr elton harriet s cheerful look and manner established hers she came back not to think of mr martin but to talk of mr elton miss nash had been telling her something which she repeated immediately with great delight mr perry had been to mrs goddard s to attend a sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met mr elton and found to his great surprize that mr elton was actually on his road to london and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whist club night which he had been never known to miss before and mr perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do mr elton had been determined to go on and had said in a _ very _ _ particular _ way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious mr perry could not quite understand him but he was very sure there must be a _ lady _ in the case and he told him so and mr elton only looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits miss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about mr elton and said looking so very significantly at her that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom mr elton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt mr elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness chapter ix mr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel with herself he was so much displeased that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven she was sorry but could not repent on the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after mr elton s return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting room he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought and as for harriet s feelings they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr martin s being no otherwise remembered than as he furnished a contrast with mr elton of the utmost advantage to the latter her views of improving her little friend s mind by a great deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few first chapters and the intention of going on to morrow it was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harriet s fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon miss nash head teacher at mrs goddard s had written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken the first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhouse s help to get a great many more emma assisted with her invention memory and taste and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form as well as quantity mr woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young he wondered he could not remember them but he hoped he should in time and it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind but he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about so much something he thought might come from that quarter it was by no means his daughter s wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition mr elton was the only one whose assistance she asked he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums that he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections and at the same time as she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled and rather sentimentally recited that well known charade my first doth affliction denote which my second is destin d to feel and my whole is the best antidote that affliction to soften and heal made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton said she that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you oh no he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life the stupidest fellow he was afraid not even miss woodhouse he stopt a moment or miss smith could inspire him the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration he called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own i do not offer it for miss smith s collection said he being my friend s i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma could understand there was deep consciousness about him and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend s he was gone the next moment after another moment s pause take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards harriet it is for you take your own but harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and emma never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself to miss charade my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth their luxury and ease another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas but ah united what reverse we have man s boasted power and freedom all are flown lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave and woman lovely woman reigns alone thy ready wit the word will soon supply may its approval beam in that soft eye she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through again to be quite certain and quite mistress of the lines and then passing it to harriet sat happily smiling and saying to herself while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness very well mr elton very well indeed i have read worse charades _ courtship _ a very good hint i give you credit for it this is feeling your way this is saying very plainly pray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance may its approval beam in that soft eye harriet exactly soft is the very word for her eye of all epithets the justest that could be given thy ready wit the word will soon supply humph harriet s ready wit all the better a man must be very much in love indeed to describe her so ah mr knightley i wish you had the benefit of this i think this would convince you for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken an excellent charade indeed and very much to the purpose things must come to a crisis soon now she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the eagerness of harriet s wondering questions what can it be miss woodhouse what can it be i have not an idea i cannot guess it in the least what can it possibly be do try to find it out miss woodhouse do help me i never saw any thing so hard is it kingdom i wonder who the friend was and who could be the young lady do you think it is a good one can it be woman and woman lovely woman reigns alone can it be neptune behold him there the monarch of the seas or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only one syllable it must be very clever or he would not have brought it oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you thinking of where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark give me the paper and listen for miss read miss smith my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth their luxury and ease that is _ court _ another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas that is _ ship _ plain as it can be now for the cream but ah united _ courtship _ you know what reverse we have man s boasted power and freedom all are flown lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave and woman lovely woman reigns alone a very proper compliment and then follows the application which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending read it in comfort to yourself there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion she read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness she could not speak but she was not wanted to speak it was enough for her to feel emma spoke for her there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment said she that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton s intentions you are his object and you will soon receive the completest proof of it i thought it must be so i thought i could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other i am very happy i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating this is a connexion which offers nothing but good it will give you every thing that you want consideration independence a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us dear miss woodhouse and dear miss woodhouse was all that harriet with many tender embraces could articulate at first but when they did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw felt anticipated and remembered just as she ought mr elton s superiority had very ample acknowledgment whatever you say is always right cried harriet and therefore i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could not have imagined it it is so much beyond any thing i deserve mr elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions about _ him _ he is so very superior only think of those sweet verses to miss dear me how clever could it really be meant for me i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that it is a certainty receive it on my judgment it is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matter of fact prose it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected i am sure a month ago i had no more idea myself the strangest things do take place when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted they do indeed and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow the course of true love never did run smooth a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage that mr elton should really be in love with me me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arm in arm with mr cole this is an alliance which whoever whatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools if they are anxious to see you _ happily _ married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be _ well _ married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them yes very true how nicely you talk i love to hear you you understand every thing you and mr elton are one as clever as the other this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read i never read one more to the purpose certainly it is as long again as almost all we have had before i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour such things in general cannot be too short harriet was too intent on the lines to hear the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind it is one thing said she presently her cheeks in a glow to have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr martin s prose such sweet lines continued harriet these two last but how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it out oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that leave it to me you do nothing he will be here this evening i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming trust to me oh miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book i am sure i have not got one half so good leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book oh but those two lines are the best of all granted for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change but take it away and all _ appropriation _ ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither give me the book i will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity i shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she very well replied emma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all you must let me read it to him harriet looked grave my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade you will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you do not let us be too solemn on the business he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade oh no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it do as you please mr woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears how does your book go on have you got any thing fresh yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh a piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read slowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations of every part as she proceeded and he was very much pleased and as she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion aye that s very just indeed that s very properly said very true woman lovely woman it is such a pretty charade my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought it nobody could have written so prettily but you emma emma only nodded and smiled after a little thinking and a very tender sigh he added ah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother was so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i can remember nothing not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza and there are several kitty a fair but frozen maid kindled a flame i yet deplore the hood wink d boy i called to aid though of his near approach afraid so fatal to my suit before and that is all that i can recollect of it but it is very clever all the way through but i think my dear you said you had got it yes papa it is written out in our second page we copied it from the elegant extracts it was garrick s you know aye very true i wish i could recollect more of it kitty a fair but frozen maid the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama i hope we shall have her here next week have you thought my dear where you shall put her and what room there will be for the children oh yes she will have her own room of course the room she always has and there is the nursery for the children just as usual you know why should there be any change i do not know my dear but it is so long since she was here not since last easter and then only for a few days mr john knightley s being a lawyer is very inconvenient poor isabella she is sadly taken away from us all and how sorry she will be when she comes not to see miss taylor here she will not be surprized papa at least i do not know my dear i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married we must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella is here yes my dear if there is time but in a very depressed tone she is coming for only one week there will not be time for any thing it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer but it seems a case of necessity mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey mr knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas though you know it is longer since they were with him than with us it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield mr woodhouse could never allow for mr knightley s claims on his brother or any body s claims on isabella except his own he sat musing a little while and then said but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does i think emma i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us she and the children might stay very well ah papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband this was too true for contradiction unwelcome as it was mr woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter s attachment to her husband she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleased with the children we are very proud of the children are not we papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john aye i wonder which she will poor little dears how glad they will be to come they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father john the second is named after his father some people are surprized i believe that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry which i thought very pretty of her and he is a very clever boy indeed they are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways they will come and stand by my chair and say grandpapa can you give me a bit of string and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas i think their father is too rough with them very often he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other well i cannot understand it that is the case with us all papa one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o clock dinner the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again harriet turned away but emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push of having thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up his ostensible reason however was to ask whether mr woodhouse s party could be made up in the evening without him or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield if he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with him had made such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber he re urged she re declined and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smith s collection your friend will not take it amiss i hope of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines mr elton certainly did not very well know what to say he looked rather doubtingly rather confused said something about honour glanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively with the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two he may be sure of every woman s approbation while he writes with such gallantry i have no hesitation in saying replied mr elton though hesitating a good deal while he spoke i have no hesitation in saying at least if my friend feels at all as _ i _ do i have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as _ i _ see it looking at the book again and replacing it on the table he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life after this speech he was gone as soon as possible emma could not think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh she ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet s share chapter x though now the middle of december there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise and on the morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who lived a little way out of highbury their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street of the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode of mr elton a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage an old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it could be it had no advantage of situation but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes emma s remark was there it is there go you and your riddle book one of these days harriet s was oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much i do not often walk this way _ now _ said emma as they proceeded but _ then _ there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury harriet she found had never in her life been inside the vicarage and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors and probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love with mr elton s seeing ready wit in her i wish we could contrive it said she but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper no message from my father she pondered but could think of nothing after a mutual silence of some minutes harriet thus began again i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are emma laughed and replied my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry i must find other people charming one other person at least and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ah so you say but i cannot believe it i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr elton you know recollecting herself is out of the question and i do _ not _ wish to see any such person i would rather not be tempted i cannot really change for the better if i were to marry i must expect to repent it dear me it is so odd to hear a woman talk so i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine fortune i do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband s house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates so silly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry to morrow but between _ us _ i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried but still you will be an old maid and that s so dreadful never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet work and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _ not _ marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephews and nieces i shall often have a niece with me do you know miss bates s niece that is i know you must have seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury by the bye _ that _ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece heaven forbid at least that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were superseded emma was very compassionate and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse she understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good will in the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to harriet as they walked away these are the sights harriet to do one good how trifling they make every thing else appear i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind very true said harriet poor creatures one can think of nothing else and really i do not think the impression will soon be over said emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them into the lane again i do not think it will stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still greater within oh dear no said her companion they walked on the lane made a slight bend and when that bend was passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near as to give emma time only to say farther ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts well smiling i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves harriet could just answer oh dear yes before the gentleman joined them the wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting he had been going to call on them his visit he would now defer but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done mr elton then turned back to accompany them to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase of love on each side i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration it must if i were not here i wish i were anywhere else anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that in short they would both be soon after her this would not do she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half boot and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would follow in half a minute they did as they were desired and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot she had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken by a child from the cottage setting out according to orders with her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield to walk by the side of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been acting just then without design and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her she gained on them however involuntarily the child s pace was quick and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them mr elton was speaking with animation harriet listening with a very pleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more when they both looked around and she was obliged to join them mr elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday s party at his friend cole s and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the celery the beet root and all the dessert this would soon have led to something better of course was her consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart if i could but have kept longer away they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and fall behind to arrange it once more she then broke the lace off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am to contrive i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i hope i am not often so ill equipped mr elton i must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on mr elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied and looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately communicated the door between them was open and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it but she fully intended that mr elton should close it it was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself it could be protracted no longer she was then obliged to be hed and make her appearance the lovers were standing together at one of the windows it had a most favourable aspect and for half a minute emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully but it would not do he had not come to the point he had been most agreeable most delightful he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious cautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure still however though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them forward to the great event chapter xi mr elton must now be left to himself it was no longer in emma s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures the coming of her sister s family was so very near at hand that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expected she did not herself expect that any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers they might advance rapidly if they would however they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no she hardly wished to have more leisure for them there are people who the more you do for them the less they will do for themselves mr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest till this year every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea bathing for the children and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions or seen at all by mr woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london even for poor isabella s sake and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms were needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished and mr and mrs john knightley their five children and a competent number of nursery maids all reaching hartfield in safety the bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs john knightley that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance all the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing which they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them mrs john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate wrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible she could never see a fault in any of them she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also much of his constitution was delicate in her own health over careful of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own mr wingfield in town as her father could be of mr perry they were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance mr john knightley was a tall gentleman like and very clever man rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour he was not an ill tempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his great perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing he was not a great favourite with his fair sister in law nothing wrong in him escaped her she was quick in feeling the little injuries to isabella which isabella never felt herself perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabella s sister but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend without praise and without blindness but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father there he had not always the patience that could have been wished mr woodhouse s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill bestowed it did not often happen for mr john knightley had really a great regard for his father in law and generally a strong sense of what was due to him but it was too often for emma s charity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured though the offence came not the beginning however of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality they had not been long seated and composed when mr woodhouse with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughter s attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last ah my dear said he poor miss taylor it is a grievous business oh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must miss her and dear emma too what a dreadful loss to you both i have been so grieved for you i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her it is a sad change indeed but i hope she is pretty well sir pretty well my dear i hope pretty well i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably mr john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply and do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father mr woodhouse hesitated not near so often my dear as i could wish oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth just as it should be said mr john knightley and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied why to be sure said mr woodhouse yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston i think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can me my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor where is the young man said john knightley has he been here on this occasion or has he not he has not been here yet replied emma there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps my dear papa he is three and twenty you forget how time passes three and twenty is he indeed well i could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept 28th and began my dear madam but i forget how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill i remember that perfectly how very pleasing and proper of him cried the good hearted mrs john knightley i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy observed mr john knightley coolly but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr weston and had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass she would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important it had a high claim to forbearance chapter xii mr knightley was to dine with them rather against the inclination of mr woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him in isabella s first day emma s sense of right however had decided it and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr knightley and herself in procuring him the proper invitation she hoped they might now become friends again she thought it was time to make up making up indeed would not do _ she _ certainly had not been in the wrong and _ he _ would never own that he had concession must be out of the question but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her the youngest a nice little girl about eight months old who was now making her first visit to hartfield and very happy to be danced about in her aunt s arms it did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike to be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong yes said he smiling and reason good i was sixteen years old when you were born a material difference then she replied and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer yes a good deal _ nearer _ but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now that s true she cried very true little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited now mr knightley a word or two more and i have done as far as good intentions went we were _ both _ right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong i only want to know that mr martin is not very very bitterly disappointed a man cannot be more so was his short full answer ah indeed i am very sorry come shake hands with me this had just taken place and with great cordiality when john knightley made his appearance and how d ye do george and john how are you succeeded in the true english style burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment which would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing for the good of the other the evening was quiet and conversable as mr woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella and the little party made two natural divisions on one side he and his daughter on the other the two mr knightleys their subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixing and emma only occasionally joining in one or the other the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative and who was always the greater talker as a magistrate he had generally some point of law to consult john about or at least some curious anecdote to give and as a farmer as keeping in hand the home farm at donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear next year and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong the plan of a drain the change of a fence the felling of a tree and the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn was entered into with as much equality of interest by john as his cooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness while they were thus comfortably occupied mr woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter my poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand and interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one of her five children how long it is how terribly long since you were here and how tired you must be after your journey you must go to bed early my dear and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together my dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the mr knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself and two basins only were ordered after a little more discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say with an air of grave reflection it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here i never had much opinion of the sea air mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat both sea air and bathing ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once come come cried emma feeling this to be an unsafe subject i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you oh good mr perry how is he sir why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where and mrs perry and the children how are they do the children grow i have a great regard for mr perry i hope he will be calling soon he will be so pleased to see my little ones i hope he will be here to morrow for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence and my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little bella s throat oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since august it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates said emma i have not heard one inquiry after them oh the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well good old mrs bates i will call upon her to morrow and take my children they are always so pleased to see my children and that excellent miss bates such thorough worthy people how are they sir why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago how sorry i am but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn mr wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy except when it has been quite an influenza that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november perry does not call it altogether a sickly season no i do not know that mr wingfield considers it _ very _ sickly except ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always a sickly season nobody is healthy in london nobody can be it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off and the air so bad no indeed _ we _ are not at all in a bad air our part of london is very superior to most others you must not confound us with london in general my dear sir the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest we are so very airy i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in but _ we _ are so remarkably airy mr wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air ah my dear it is not like hartfield you make the best of it but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same now i cannot say that i think you are any of you looking well at present i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case i trust at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband middling my dear i cannot compliment you i think mr john knightley very far from looking well what is the matter sir did you speak to me cried mr john knightley hearing his own name i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home my dear isabella exclaimed he hastily pray do not concern yourself about my looks be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother cried emma about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong and she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing worse to hear than isabella s kind inquiry after jane fairfax and jane fairfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising that sweet amiable jane fairfax said mrs john knightley it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all she would be such a delightful companion for emma mr woodhouse agreed to it all but added our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet i am most happy to hear it but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior and exactly emma s age this topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of similar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said much praise and many comments undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably but unfortunately among the failures which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in her own cook at south end a young woman hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin often as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able to get any thing tolerable here was a dangerous opening ah said mr woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern the ejaculation in emma s ear expressed ah there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end it does not bear talking of and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel after an interval of some minutes however he began with i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here but why should you be sorry sir i assure you it did the children a great deal of good and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end south end is an unhealthy place perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere perry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the sea bathing places a fine open sea he says and very pure air and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea a quarter of a mile off very comfortable you should have consulted perry but my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how great it would have been an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill judged measure emma s attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he had reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her brother in law s breaking out mr perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another i may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry i want his directions no more than his drugs he paused and growing cooler in a moment added with only sarcastic dryness if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself true true cried mr knightley with most ready interposition very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion mr woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother and better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it chapter xiii there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs john knightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister she had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly it was a delightful visit perfect in being much too short in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas mr weston would take no denial they must all dine at randalls one day even mr woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party how they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty if he could but as his son and daughter s carriage and horses were actually at hartfield he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also harriet mr elton and mr knightley their own especial set were the only persons invited to meet them the hours were to be early as well as the numbers few mr woodhouse s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing the evening before this great event for it was a very great event that mr woodhouse should dine out on the 24th of december had been spent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house emma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat mrs goddard was full of care and affection mr perry was talked of and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss without many tears emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mrs goddard s unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much mr elton s would be depressed when he knew her state and left her at last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much she had not advanced many yards from mrs goddard s door when she was met by mr elton himself evidently coming towards it and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid of whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going to inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfield they were overtaken by mr john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for they joined company and proceeded together emma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her a quick low pulse c and she was sorry to find from mrs goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore throats and had often alarmed her with them mr elton looked all alarm on the occasion as he exclaimed a sore throat i hope not infectious i hope not of a putrid infectious sort has perry seen her indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend let me entreat you to run no risks why does not perry see her emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs goddard s experience and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwards as if quite another subject it is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night mr elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of her s he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit but emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening you do quite right said she we will make your apologies to mr and mrs weston but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were mr elton s only objection and mr elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction it was a done thing mr elton was to go and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her well said she to herself this is most strange after i had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behind most strange indeed but there is i believe in many men especially single men such an inclination such a passion for dining out a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to it and this must be the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked what a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her soon afterwards mr elton quitted them and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs goddard s for news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be able to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour after a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley began with i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works mr elton s manners are not perfect replied emma but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority there is such perfect good temper and good will in mr elton as one cannot but value yes said mr john knightley presently with some slyness he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you me she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to be mr elton s object such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now mr elton in love with me what an idea i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly i think your manners to him encouraging i speak as a friend emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken mr elton and i are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel he said no more mr woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others too full of the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it the cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage was in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour the preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least which mr john knightley did not by any means like he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent a man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing it is the greatest absurdity actually snowing at this moment the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home and the folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem it and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man s house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the very true my love which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence she allowed him to talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening her lips they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and mr elton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject mr elton was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her she had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the same not better _ my _ report from mrs goddard s said she presently was not so pleasant as i had hoped not better was _ my _ answer his face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered oh no i am grieved to find i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs goddard s door which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse very much grieved and concerned i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning emma smiled and answered my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed mr perry has been with her as you probably heard yes i imagined that is i did not he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day dreadful exactly so indeed she will be missed every moment this was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable but it should have lasted longer emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment what an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin for carriages how very comfortable they make it impossible to feel cold with such precautions the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely of no consequence it is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter ha snows a little i see yes said john knightley and i think we shall have a good deal of it christmas weather observed mr elton quite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this day s party which it might very possibly have done for mr woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings at christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather i was snowed up at a friend s house once for a week nothing could be pleasanter i went for only one night and could not get away till that very day se nnight mr john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but said only coolly i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls at another time emma might have been amused but she was too much astonished now at mr elton s spirits for other feelings harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party we are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort charming people mr and mrs weston mrs weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society it will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any mr weston s dining room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part i would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two i think you will agree with me turning with a soft air to emma i think i shall certainly have your approbation though mr knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of london may not quite enter into our feelings i know nothing of the large parties of london sir i never dine with any body indeed in a tone of wonder and pity i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment my first enjoyment replied john knightley as they passed through the sweep gate will be to find myself safe at hartfield again chapter xiv some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs weston s drawing room mr elton must compose his joyous looks and mr john knightley disperse his ill humour mr elton must smile less and mr john knightley more to fit them for the place emma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as happy as she was to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons mr weston was a great favourite and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself she could tell nothing of hartfield in which mrs weston had not a lively concern and half an hour s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends was one of the first gratifications of each this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day s visit might not afford which certainly did not belong to the present half hour but the very sight of mrs weston her smile her touch her voice was grateful to emma and she determined to think as little as possible of mr elton s oddities or of any thing else unpleasant and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost the misfortune of harriet s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival mr woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own and isabella s coming and of emma s being to follow and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter when the others appeared and mrs weston who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma emma s project of forgetting mr elton for a while made her rather sorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion instead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me absurd and insufferable yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be so interested about her father and so delighted with mrs weston and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would be lover and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners for her own sake she could not be rude and for harriet s in the hope that all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil but it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst the others in the most overpowering period of mr elton s nonsense which she particularly wished to listen to she heard enough to know that mr weston was giving some information about his son she heard the words my son and frank and my son repeated several times over and from a few other half syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son but before she could quiet mr elton the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward now it so happened that in spite of emma s resolution of never marrying there was something in the name in the idea of mr frank churchill which always interested her she had frequently thought especially since his father s marriage with miss taylor that if she _ were _ to marry he was the very person to suit her in age character and condition he seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of that mr and mrs weston did think of it she was very strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him or by any body else to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for she had a great curiosity to see him a decided intention of finding him pleasant of being liked by him to a certain degree and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends imaginations with such sensations mr elton s civilities were dreadfully ill timed but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very cross and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again or the substance of it from the open hearted mr weston so it proved for when happily released from mr elton and seated by mr weston at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to her we want only two more to be just the right number i should like to see two more here your pretty little friend miss smith and my son and then i should say we were quite complete i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing room that we are expecting frank i had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a fortnight emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented to his proposition of mr frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete he has been wanting to come to us continued mr weston ever since september every letter has been full of it but he cannot command his own time he has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another put off she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do but she does not know the parties so well as i do the case you see is but this is quite between ourselves i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room there are secrets in all families you know the case is that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january and that frank s coming depends upon their being put off if they are not put off he cannot stir but i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point i have not the smallest doubt of the issue i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice of doing i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied emma but am disposed to side with you mr weston if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe yes i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life she is an odd woman but i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank s account for i do believe her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper emma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to mrs weston very soon after their moving into the drawing room wishing her joy yet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming mrs weston agreed to it but added that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of for i cannot depend upon his coming i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing mr weston i dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world my emma replied mrs weston smiling what is the certainty of caprice then turning to isabella who had not been attending before you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill replied isabella and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them emma wished she had been alone with mrs weston she should then have heard more mrs weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella and she really believed would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge but at present there was nothing more to be said mr woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing room to be sitting long after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable while he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity of saying and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine he ought to come said emma if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s not having it in his power to do as much as that a young _ woman _ if she fall into bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young _ man _ s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do replied mrs weston one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules _ she _ is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite now according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards _ him _ she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _ when _ it will be emma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied unless he comes he may have a great deal of influence on some points continued mrs weston and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us chapter xv mr woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour before the other gentlemen appeared mr weston was chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort but at last the drawing room party did receive an augmentation mr elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in mrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa he joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr frank churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend her fair lovely amiable friend did she know had she heard any thing about her since their being at randalls he felt much anxiety he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably and in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat and emma was quite in charity with him but at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on harriet s more anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick chamber again for the present to entreat her to _ promise _ _ him _ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her she was vexed it did appear there was no concealing it exactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty in behaving with temper he turned to mrs weston to implore her assistance would not she give him her support would not she add her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs goddard s till it were certain that miss smith s disorder had no infection he could not be satisfied without a promise would not she give him her influence in procuring it so scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless for herself she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to day and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself is this fair mrs weston judge between us have not i some right to complain i am sure of your kind support and aid emma saw mrs weston s surprize and felt that it must be great at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose she could only give him a look but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving her all her attention she had not time to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidly did another subject succeed for mr john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind concluding with these words to mr woodhouse this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow poor mr woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else had something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer mrs weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son in law who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly i admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon every body must have seen the snow coming on i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight mr weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest it should make mr woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty he wished the road might be impassable that he might be able to keep them all at randalls and with the utmost good will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him that with a little contrivance every body might be lodged which she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done was mr woodhouse s first exclamation and all that he could say for some time to her he looked for comfort and her assurances of safety her representation of the excellence of the horses and of james and of their having so many friends about them revived him a little his eldest daughter s alarm was equal to his own the horror of being blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager to have it settled that her father and emma should remain at randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them you had better order the carriage directly my love said she i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk i am not at all afraid i should not mind walking half the way i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold indeed replied he then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold walk home you are prettily shod for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses isabella turned to mrs weston for her approbation of the plan mrs weston could only approve isabella then went to emma but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away and they were still discussing the point when mr knightley who had left the room immediately after his brother s first report of the snow came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence he had gone beyond the sweep some way along the highbury road the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground a very few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting and there was every appearance of its being soon over he had seen the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend to isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father s account who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending mr knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences thus your father will not be easy why do not you go i am ready if the others are shall i ring the bell yes do and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for a few minutes more and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over the carriage came and mr woodhouse always the first object on such occasions was carefully attended to his own by mr knightley and mr weston but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for he was afraid they should have a very bad drive he was afraid poor isabella would not like it and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind he did not know what they had best do they must keep as much together as they could and james was talked to and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage isabella stept in after her father john knightley forgetting that he did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally so that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them and that they were to have a tête à tête drive it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure previous to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked to him of harriet and the three quarters of a mile would have seemed but one but now she would rather it had not happened she believed he had been drinking too much of mr weston s good wine and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense to restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had they passed the sweep gate and joined the other carriage than she found her subject cut up her hand seized her attention demanded and mr elton actually making violent love to her availing himself of the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already well known hoping fearing adoring ready to die if she refused him but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect and in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible it really was so without scruple without apology without much apparent diffidence mr elton the lover of harriet was professing himself _ her _ lover she tried to stop him but vainly he would go on and say it all angry as she was the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour accordingly with a mixture of the serious and the playful which she hoped would best suit his half and half state she replied i am very much astonished mr elton this to _ me _ you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to _ me _ if you please miss smith message to miss smith what could she possibly mean and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful pretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness mr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in such a manner command yourself enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it but mr elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at all to confuse his intellects he perfectly knew his own meaning and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at all he resumed the subject of his own passion and was very urgent for a favourable answer as she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied it is impossible for me to doubt any longer you have made yourself too clear mr elton my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express after such behaviour as i have witnessed during the last month to miss smith such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing to be addressing me in this manner this is an unsteadiness of character indeed which i had not supposed possible believe me sir i am far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions good heaven cried mr elton what can be the meaning of this miss smith i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence never paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and i am very sorry extremely sorry but miss smith indeed oh miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character i have thought only of you i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself you cannot really seriously doubt it no in an accent meant to be insinuating i am sure you have seen and understood me it would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing this which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr elton s sanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he joyously exclaimed charming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence it confesses that you have long understood me no sir cried emma it confesses no such thing so far from having long understood you i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views till this moment as to myself i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings nothing could be farther from my wishes your attachment to my friend harriet your pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith that you have never thought seriously of her never madam cried he affronted in his turn never i assure you _ i _ think seriously of miss smith miss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to every body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received encouragement i give you encouragement sir you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance i am exceedingly sorry but it is well that the mistake ends where it does had the same behaviour continued miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views not being aware probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of but as it is the disappointment is single and i trust will not be lasting i have no thoughts of matrimony at present he was too angry to say another word her manner too decided to invite supplication and in this state of swelling resentment and mutually deep mortification they had to continue together a few minutes longer for the fears of mr woodhouse had confined them to a foot pace if there had not been so much anger there would have been desperate awkwardness but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane or when it stopped they found themselves all at once at the door of his house and he was out before another syllable passed emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night the compliment was just returned coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits she was then conveyed to hartfield there she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage lane turning a corner which he could never bear to think of and in strange hands a mere common coachman no james and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well for mr john knightley ashamed of his ill humour was now all kindness and attention and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father as to seem if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party except herself but her mind had never been in such perturbation and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection chapter xvi the hair was curled and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think and be miserable it was a wretched business indeed such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for such a development of every thing most unwelcome such a blow for harriet that was the worst of all every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort or other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken more in error more disgraced by mis judgment than she actually was could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have borne any thing he might have doubled his presumption to me but poor harriet how she could have been so deceived he protested that he had never thought seriously of harriet never she looked back as well as she could but it was all confusion she had taken up the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it his manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious or she could not have been so misled the picture how eager he had been about the picture and the charade and an hundred other circumstances how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet to be sure the charade with its ready wit but then the soft eyes in fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth who could have seen through such thick headed nonsense certainly she had often especially of late thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way as a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the gentleness of his address true elegance was sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never for an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harriet s friend to mr john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject for the first start of its possibility there was no denying that those brothers had penetration she remembered what mr knightley had once said to her about mr elton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that mr elton would never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself it was dreadfully mortifying but mr elton was proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full of his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others contrary to the usual course of things mr elton s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion his professions and his proposals did him no service she thought nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes he wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for there had been no real affection either in his language or manners sighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less allied with real love she need not trouble herself to pity him he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty or with ten but that he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry him should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind look down upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her it was most provoking perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield the younger branch of a very ancient family and that the eltons were nobody the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all the rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself in every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility but he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must have been his dependence and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy like mr elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite if _ she _ had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder that _ he _ with self interest to blind him should have mistaken hers the first error and the worst lay at her door it was foolish it was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together it was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more here have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man she might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him oh that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin there i was quite right that was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left the rest to time and chance i was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having i ought not to have attempted more but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time i have been but half a friend to her and if she were _ not _ to feel this disappointment so very much i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her william coxe oh no i could not endure william coxe a pert young lawyer she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed a more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been and might be and must be the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffering with the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings concealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully to youth and natural cheerfulness like emma s though under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to depend on getting tolerably out of it it was a great consolation that mr elton should not be really in love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him that harriet s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive and that there could be no necessity for any body s knowing what had passed except the three principals and especially for her father s being given a moment s uneasiness about it these were very cheering thoughts and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present the weather was most favourable for her though christmas day she could not go to church mr woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas the ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most honourable prisoner no intercourse with harriet possible but by note no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day and no need to find excuses for mr elton s absenting himself it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house too wise to stir out and to hear him say to mr knightley whom no weather could keep entirely from them ah mr knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr elton these days of confinement would have been but for her private perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly suited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off his ill humour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield he was always agreeable and obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body but with all the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease chapter xvii mr and mrs john knightley were not detained long at hartfield the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move and mr woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole party set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella which poor isabella passing her life with those she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults and always innocently busy might have been a model of right feminine happiness the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr elton to mr woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note to say with mr elton s best compliments that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath where in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends he had engaged to spend a few weeks and very much regretted the impossibility he was under from various circumstances of weather and business of taking a personal leave of mr woodhouse of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense and had mr woodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them emma was most agreeably surprized mr elton s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired she admired him for contriving it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father from which she was so pointedly excluded she had not even a share in his opening compliments her name was not mentioned and there was so striking a change in all this and such an ill judged solemnity of leave taking in his graceful acknowledgments as she thought at first could not escape her father s suspicion it did however her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey and his fears that mr elton might never get safely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language it was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening mr woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman s return she went to mrs goddard s accordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary penance of communication and a severe one it was she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her ideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last six weeks the confession completely renewed her first shame and the sight of harriet s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again harriet bore the intelligence very well blaming nobody and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching seemed on harriet s side not her own harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of the affection of such a man as mr elton would have been too great a distinction she never could have deserved him and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible her tears fell abundantly but her grief was so truly artless that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma s eyes and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the two and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple minded and ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of her life her second duty now inferior only to her father s claims was to promote harriet s comfort and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match making she got her to hartfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness striving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation to drive mr elton from her thoughts time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr elton in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet s age and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr elton s return as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them harriet did think him all perfection and maintained the non existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness and did in truth prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen but yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _ unrequited _ that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force if mr elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine harriet s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for each for all three not one of them had the power of removal or of effecting any material change of society they must encounter each other and make the best of it harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs goddard s mr elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth where the wound had been given there must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace for herself chapter xviii mr frank churchill did not come when the time proposed drew near mrs weston s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse for the present he could not be spared to his very great mortification and regret but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period mrs weston was exceedingly disappointed much more disappointed in fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober but a sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression it soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again for half an hour mr weston was surprized and sorry but then he began to perceive that frank s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan better time of year better weather and that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner these feelings rapidly restored his comfort while mrs weston of a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer suffered a great deal more herself emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr frank churchill s not coming except as a disappointment at randalls the acquaintance at present had no charm for her she wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it was desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance and enter as warmly into mr and mrs weston s disappointment as might naturally belong to their friendship she was the first to announce it to mr knightley and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps rather more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry the pleasure of looking at somebody new the gala day to highbury entire which the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections on the churchills again found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr knightley and to her great amusement perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion and making use of mrs weston s arguments against herself the churchills are very likely in fault said mr knightley coolly but i dare say he might come if he would i do not know why you should say so he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof how odd you are what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january a man at his age what is he three or four and twenty cannot be without the means of doing as much as that it is impossible that s easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master you are the worst judge in the world mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot want money he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some watering place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth this proves that he can leave the churchills yes sometimes he can and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to morrow if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going no said emma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine such conduct practicable depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now we shall never agree about him cried emma but that is nothing extraordinary i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not mr weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of man s perfection i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s having any right to complain his letters disgust me your feelings are singular they seem to satisfy every body else i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be very amiable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him you seem determined to think ill of him me not at all replied mr knightley rather displeased i do not want to think ill of him i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is well grown and good looking with smooth plausible manners well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley what a _ sensation _ his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him and mine said mr knightley warmly is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man the practised politician who is to read every body s character and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point i will say no more about him cried emma you turn every thing to evil we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here prejudiced i am not prejudiced but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it my love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour he is a person i never think of from one month s end to another said mr knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma immediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend why he should be angry to take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him for with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid to his charge she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another volume ii chapter i emma and harriet had been walking together one morning and in emma s opinion had been talking enough of mr elton for that day she could not think that harriet s solace or her own sins required more and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive mr elton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done they were just approaching the house where lived mrs and miss bates she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers there was always sufficient reason for such an attention mrs and miss bates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts she had had many a hint from mr knightley and some from her own heart as to her deficiency but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable a waste of time tiresome women and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second rate and third rate of highbury who were calling on them for ever and therefore she seldom went near them but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in observing as she proposed it to harriet that as well as she could calculate they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax the house belonged to people in business mrs and miss bates occupied the drawing room floor and there in the very moderate sized apartment which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after mr woodhouse s health cheerful communications about her mother s and sweet cake from the beaufet mrs cole had just been there just called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an hour with them and _ she _ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr elton there was intimacy between them and mr cole had heard from mr elton since his going away emma knew what was coming they must have the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone and how much he was engaged in company and what a favourite he was wherever he went and how full the master of the ceremonies ball had been and she went through it very well with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always putting forward to prevent harriet s being obliged to say a word this she had been prepared for when she entered the house but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury and their card parties she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr elton but he was actually hurried off by miss bates she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles to usher in a letter from her niece oh yes mr elton i understand certainly as to dancing mrs cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was mrs cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very great a favourite there whenever she is with us mrs cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can and so she began inquiring after her directly saying i know you cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time for writing and when i immediately said but indeed we have we had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized have you upon your honour said she well that is quite unexpected do let me hear what she says emma s politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well thank you you are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt while eagerly hunting for the letter oh here it is i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her a letter from jane that she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says but first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letter only two pages you see hardly two and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well she often says when the letter is first opened well hetty now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker work don t you ma am and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word and indeed though my mother s eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles it is such a blessing my mother s are really very good indeed jane often says when she is here i am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do and so much fine work as you have done too i only wish my eyes may last me as well all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfax s handwriting you are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse s my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know ma am addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it she was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming very rude of making her escape from jane fairfax s letter and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention my mother s deafness is very trifling you see just nothing at all by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mother s time of life and it really is full two years you know since she was here we never were so long without seeing her before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now are you expecting miss fairfax here soon oh yes next week indeed that must be a very great pleasure thank you you are very kind yes next week every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see her yes friday or saturday she cannot say which because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days so very good of them to send her the whole way but they always do you know oh yes friday or saturday next that is what she writes about that is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday yes so i imagined i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to day so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon my mother is so delighted for she is to be three months with us at least three months she says so positively as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland mrs dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them again for till she married last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother or her father i declare i do not know which it was but we shall see presently in jane s letter wrote in mr dixon s name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat baly craig a beautiful place i fancy jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses and as jane used to be very often walking out with them for colonel and mrs campbell were very particular about their daughter s not walking out often with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself he is a most amiable charming young man i believe jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emma s brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr dixon and the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell very true very true indeed the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months together not able to come if any thing was to happen but you see every thing turns out for the best they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to come over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _ joint _ invitation jane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention he is a most charming young man ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit i can never think of it without trembling but ever since we had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs bates yes entirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel and mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly _ wish _ her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately i am concerned to hear of it i think they judge wisely but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed mrs dixon i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax oh no you are very obliging to say such things but certainly not there is no comparison between them miss campbell always was absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable yes that of course jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th of november as i am going to read to you and has never been well since a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us just like her so considerate but however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we should do it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following as you will find from jane s letter so sudden you may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with bless me poor jane is ill which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her i am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet and beginning to rise my father will be expecting us i had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes when i first entered the house i merely called because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs bates but i have been so pleasantly detained now however we must wish you and mrs bates good morning and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded she regained the street happy in this that though much had been forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfax s letter she had been able to escape the letter itself chapter ii jane fairfax was an orphan the only child of mrs bates s youngest daughter the marriage of lieut fairfax of the regiment of infantry and miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure hope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards and this girl by birth she belonged to highbury and when at three years old on losing her mother she became the property the charge the consolation the foundling of her grandmother and aunt there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there of her being taught only what very limited means could command and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person good understanding and warm hearted well meaning relations but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny this was colonel campbell who had very highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for such attentions during a severe camp fever as he believed had saved his life these were claims which he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in his power when he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her he was a married man with only one living child a girl about jane s age and jane became their guest paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old his daughter s great fondness for her and his own wish of being a real friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education it was accepted and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbell s family and had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother from time to time the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbell s power for though his income by pay and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter s but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter such was jane fairfax s history she had fallen into good hands known nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given an excellent education living constantly with right minded and well informed people her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbell s residence being in london every lighter talent had been done full justice to by the attendance of first rate masters her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children fully competent to the office of instruction herself but she was too much beloved to be parted with neither father nor mother could promote and the daughter could not endure it the evil day was put off it was easy to decide that she was still too young and jane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society and a judicious mixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of jane s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents they continued together with unabated regard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of mr dixon a young man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly and happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn this event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning she had long resolved that one and twenty should be the period with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate she had resolved at one and twenty to complete the sacrifice and retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse equal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever the good sense of colonel and mrs campbell could not oppose such a resolution though their feelings did as long as they lived no exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly but this would be selfishness what must be at last had better be soon perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished still however affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter s marriage and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength they must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits seemed under the most favourable circumstances to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some truths not told it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health than on any thing else certain it was that she was to come and that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it mr frank churchill must put up for the present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness of a two years absence emma was sorry to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months to be always doing more than she wished and less than she ought why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer mr knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time there were moments of self examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her but she could never get acquainted with her she did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reserve such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not and then her aunt was such an eternal talker and she was made such a fuss with by every body and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate because their ages were the same every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other these were her reasons she had no better it was a dislike so little just every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating jane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had herself the highest value for elegance her height was pretty just such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most becoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance of ill health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two emma could not but feel all this and then her face her features there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty her eyes a deep grey with dark eye lashes and eyebrows had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom it was a style of beauty of which elegance was the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her principles admire it elegance which whether of person or of mind she saw so little in highbury there not to be vulgar was distinction and merit in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike her no longer when she took in her history indeed her situation as well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance was destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going to live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect especially if to every well known particular entitling her to interest were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr dixon which she had so naturally started to herself in that case nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr dixon s affections from his wife or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first if it were love it might be simple single successless love on her side alone she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison while a sharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best the purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit to ireland and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty upon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings as made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her these were charming feelings but not lasting before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors than saying to mr knightley she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state former provocations reappeared the aunt was as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself and jane s offences rose again they had music emma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance she was besides which was the worst of all so cold so cautious there was no getting at her real opinion wrapt up in a cloak of politeness she seemed determined to hazard nothing she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved if any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr dixon s character or her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness of the match it was all general approbation and smoothness nothing delineated or distinguished it did her no service however her caution was thrown away emma saw its artifice and returned to her first surmises there probably _ was _ something more to conceal than her own preference mr dixon perhaps had been very near changing one friend for the other or been fixed only to miss campbell for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds the like reserve prevailed on other topics she and mr frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time it was known that they were a little acquainted but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was was he handsome she believed he was reckoned a very fine young man was he agreeable he was generally thought so did he appear a sensible young man a young man of information at a watering place or in a common london acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points manners were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr churchill she believed every body found his manners pleasing emma could not forgive her chapter iii emma could not forgive her but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr knightley who had been of the party and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with mr woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma he had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement a very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers swept away particularly pleasant you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma you left nothing undone i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmother s it must have been a real indulgence i am happy you approved said emma smiling but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield no my dear said her father instantly _ that _ i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough no said mr knightley nearly at the same time you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension i think you understand me therefore an arch look expressed i understand you well enough but she said only miss fairfax is reserved i always told you she was a little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence what arises from discretion must be honoured you think her diffident i do not see it my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close by her you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant evening oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained i am disappointed was his only answer i hope every body had a pleasant evening said mr woodhouse in his quiet way i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the present said and with a sincerity which no one could question she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart mr knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express and before he could make any reply mr woodhouse whose thoughts were on the bates s said it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and i have often wished but it is so little one can venture to do small trifling presents of any thing uncommon now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate hartfield pork is not like any other pork but still it is pork and my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork i think we had better send the leg do not you think so my dear my dear papa i sent the whole hind quarter i knew you would wish it there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like that s right my dear very right i had not thought of it before but that is the best way they must not over salt the leg and then if it is not over salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome emma said mr knightley presently i have a piece of news for you you like news and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you news oh yes i always like news what is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at randalls he had time only to say no not at randalls i have not been near randalls when the door was thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room full of thanks and full of news miss bates knew not which to give quickest mr knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him oh my dear sir how are you this morning my dear miss woodhouse i come quite over powered such a beautiful hind quarter of pork you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr elton is going to be married emma had not had time even to think of mr elton and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start and a little blush at the sound there is my news i thought it would interest you said mr knightley with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them but where could _ you _ hear it cried miss bates where could you possibly hear it mr knightley for it is not five minutes since i received mrs cole s note no it cannot be more than five or at least ten for i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come out i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork jane was standing in the passage were not you jane for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan large enough so i said i would go down and see and jane said shall i go down instead for i think you have a little cold and patty has been washing the kitchen oh my dear said i well and just then came the note a miss hawkins that s all i know a miss hawkins of bath but mr knightley how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr cole told mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me a miss hawkins i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly well that is quite i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting my dear sir you really are too bountiful my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her we consider our hartfield pork replied mr woodhouse indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us we may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course here was a sly glance at emma he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled mr elton going to be married said emma as soon as she could speak he will have every body s wishes for his happiness he is very young to settle was mr woodhouse s observation he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse said miss bates joyfully my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him jane s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her no i have never seen mr elton she replied starting on this appeal is he is he a tall man who shall answer that question cried emma my father would say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir turning to mr woodhouse i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her said emma nothing i suppose can be known one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance he has been gone only four weeks nobody had any information to give and after a few more wonderings emma said you are silent miss fairfax but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell s account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins when i have seen mr elton replied jane i dare say i shall be interested but i believe it requires _ that _ with me and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse said miss bates four weeks yesterday a miss hawkins well i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i ever mrs cole once whispered to me but i immediately said no mr elton is a most worthy young man but in short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries i do not pretend to it what is before me i see at the same time nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspired miss woodhouse lets me chatter on so good humouredly she knows i would not offend for the world how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now have you heard from mrs john knightley lately oh those dear little children jane do you know i always fancy mr dixon like mr john knightley i mean in person tall and with that sort of look and not very talkative quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all very odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand one takes up a notion and runs away with it mr dixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome handsome oh no far from it certainly plain i told you he was plain my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself oh as for me my judgment is worth nothing where i have a regard i always think a person well looking but i gave what i believed the general opinion when i called him plain well my dear jane i believe we must be running away the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed i shall just go round by mrs cole s but i shall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directly i would not have you out in a shower we think she is the better for highbury already thank you we do indeed i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but _ boiled _ pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing good morning to you my dear sir oh mr knightley is coming too well that is so very i am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm mr elton and miss hawkins good morning to you emma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry and to marry strangers too and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news as proving that mr elton could not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet harriet must feel it and all that she could hope was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly from others it was now about the time that she was likely to call if she were to meet miss bates in her way and upon its beginning to rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs goddard s and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation the shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the oh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation as the blow was given emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening and harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what she had to tell she had set out from mrs goddard s half an hour ago she had been afraid it would rain she had been afraid it would pour down every moment but she thought she might get to hartfield first she had hurried on as fast as possible but then as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast as she could and took shelter at ford s ford s was the principal woollen draper linen draper and haberdasher s shop united the shop first in size and fashion in the place and so there she had set without an idea of any thing in the world full ten minutes perhaps when all of a sudden who should come in to be sure it was so very odd but they always dealt at ford s who should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother dear miss woodhouse only think i thought i should have fainted i did not know what to do i was sitting near the door elizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and i kept sitting near the door oh dear i was so miserable i am sure i must have been as white as my gown i could not go away you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there oh dear miss woodhouse well at last i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me do you think he was miss woodhouse for presently she came forward came quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands if i would she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to _ try _ to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i said i was in such a tremble i remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think i found he was coming up towards me too slowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke and i answered and i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully you know one can t tell how and then i took courage and said it did not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by mr cole s stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round by the stables i believe i did but i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it oh miss woodhouse i would rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly and elizabeth too oh miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again very sincerely did emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in her power she was obliged to stop and think she was not thoroughly comfortable herself the young man s conduct and his sister s seemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them as harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour but she had believed them to be well meaning worthy people before and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion it was folly to be disturbed by it of course he must be sorry to lose her they must be all sorry ambition as well as love had probably been mortified they might all have hoped to rise by harriet s acquaintance and besides what was the value of harriet s description so easily pleased so little discerning what signified her praise she exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite unworthy of being dwelt on it might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it harriet said very true and she would not think about it but still she talked of it still she could talk of nothing else and emma at last in order to put the martins out of her head was obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give with so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a state of mind in poor harriet such a conclusion of mr elton s importance with her mr elton s rights however gradually revived though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining any influence to alarm as harriet now lived the martins could not get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her refusal of the brother the sisters never had been at mrs goddard s and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again with any necessity or even any power of speech chapter iv human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations that a young person who either marries or dies is sure of being kindly spoken of a week had not passed since miss hawkins s name was first mentioned in highbury before she was by some means or other discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind to be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable and when mr elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects and circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more for him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose music she principally played mr elton returned a very happy man he had gone away rejected and mortified disappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing the right lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one he had gone away deeply offended he came back engaged to another and to another as superior of course to the first as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost he came back gay and self satisfied eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse and defying miss smith the charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune of so many thousands as would always be called ten a point of some dignity as well as some convenience the story told well he had not thrown himself away he had gained a woman of 10 000 _ l _ or thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice the history which he had to give mrs cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious the steps so quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at mr green s and the party at mrs brown s smiles and blushes rising in importance with consciousness and agitation richly scattered the lady had been so easily impressed so sweetly disposed had in short to use a most intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him that vanity and prudence were equally contented he had caught both substance and shadow both fortune and affection and was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself and his own concerns expecting to be congratulated ready to be laughed at and with cordial fearless smiles now addressing all the young ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago he would have been more cautiously gallant the wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves to please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for and when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation which a certain glance of mrs cole s did not seem to contradict that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride during his present short stay emma had barely seen him but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension now spread over his air she was in fact beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance a lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again she wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly be lessened by his marriage many vain solicitudes would be prevented many awkwardnesses smoothed by it a _ mrs _ _ elton _ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark it would be almost beginning their life of civility again of the lady individually emma thought very little she was good enough for mr elton no doubt accomplished enough for highbury handsome enough to look plain probably by harriet s side as to connexion there emma was perfectly easy persuaded that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet he had done nothing on that article truth seemed attainable _ what _ she was must be uncertain but _ who _ she was might be found out and setting aside the 10 000 l it did not appear that she was at all harriet s superior she brought no name no blood no alliance miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol merchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath but bristol was her home the very heart of bristol for though the father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remained in the law line nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter had lived emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney and too stupid to rise and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister who was _ very _ _ well _ _ married _ to a gentleman in a _ great _ _ way _ near bristol who kept two carriages that was the wind up of the history that was the glory of miss hawkins could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all she had talked her into love but alas she was not so easily to be talked out of it the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet s mind was not to be talked away he might be superseded by another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer even a robert martin would have been sufficient but nothing else she feared would cure her harriet was one of those who having once begun would be always in love and now poor girl she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr elton she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other emma saw him only once but two or three times every day harriet was sure _ just _ to meet with him or _ just _ to miss him _ just _ to hear his voice or see his shoulder _ just _ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture she was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when at hartfield she was always among those who saw no fault in mr elton and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns and every report therefore every guess all that had already occurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs comprehending income servants and furniture was continually in agitation around her her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins s happiness and continual observation of how much he seemed attached his air as he walked by the house the very sitting of his hat being all in proof of how much he was in love had it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain to her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of harriet s mind emma would have been amused by its variations sometimes mr elton predominated sometimes the martins and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other mr elton s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr martin the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martin s calling at mrs goddard s a few days afterwards harriet had not been at home but a note had been prepared and left for her written in the very style to touch a small mixture of reproach with a great deal of kindness and till mr elton himself appeared she had been much occupied by it continually pondering over what could be done in return and wishing to do more than she dared to confess but mr elton in person had driven away all such cares while he staid the martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin s visit how that visit was to be acknowledged what would be necessary and what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful consideration absolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would be ingratitude it must not be and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance after much thinking she could determine on nothing better than harriet s returning the visit but in a way that if they had understanding should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill while she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future she could think of nothing better and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve something of ingratitude merely glossed over it must be done or what would become of harriet chapter v small heart had harriet for visiting only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs goddard s her evil stars had led her to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to _ the rev philip elton white hart bath _ was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher s cart which was to convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world excepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank she went however and when they reached the farm and she was to be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier apple trees to the front door the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour she went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married and settled in donwell the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again and miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay and unattended by any alarming young man she came solitarily down the gravel walk a miss martin just appearing at the door and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account she was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating she had seen only mrs martin and the two girls they had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time till just at last when mrs martin s saying all of a sudden that she thought miss smith was grown had brought on a more interesting subject and a warmer manner in that very room she had been measured last september with her two friends there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window _ he _ had done it they all seemed to remember the day the hour the party the occasion to feel the same consciousness the same regrets to be ready to return to the same good understanding and they were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma must suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage reappeared and all was over the style of the visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago emma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally harriet must suffer it was a bad business she would have given a great deal or endured a great deal to have had the martins in a higher rank of life they were so deserving that a _ little _ higher should have been enough but as it was how could she have done otherwise impossible she could not repent they must be separated but there was a great deal of pain in the process so much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure it her mind was quite sick of mr elton and the martins the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary it was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard that neither master nor mistress was at home they had both been out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield this is too bad cried emma as they turned away and now we shall just miss them too provoking i do not know when i have been so disappointed and she leaned back in the corner to indulge her murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of both such being the commonest process of a not ill disposed mind presently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt by mr and mrs weston who were standing to speak to her there was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound for mr weston immediately accosted her with how d ye do how d ye do we have been sitting with your father glad to see him so well frank comes to morrow i had a letter this morning we see him to morrow by dinner time to a certainty he is at oxford to day and he comes for a whole fortnight i knew it would be so if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days i was always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather we shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr weston s confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not less to the purpose to know that _ she _ thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits the worn out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moment s thought she hoped mr elton would now be talked of no more mr weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command as well as the route and the method of his journey and she listened and smiled and congratulated i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech from his wife we had better move on mr weston said she we are detaining the girls well well i am ready and turning again to emma but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man you have only had _ my _ account you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing think of me to morrow my dear emma about four o clock was mrs weston s parting injunction spoken with some anxiety and meant only for her four o clock depend upon it he will be here by three was mr weston s quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting emma s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore a different air james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to harriet she saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford was a question however which did not augur much but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time the morning of the interesting day arrived and mrs weston s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve o clock that she was to think of her at four my dear dear anxious friend said she in mental soliloquy while walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful for every body s comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here i am sure they will bring him soon she opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father mr weston and his son they had been arrived only a few minutes and mr weston had scarcely hed his explanation of frank s being a day before his time and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when she appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure the frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest was actually before her he was presented to her and she did not think too much had been said in his praise he was a _ very _ good looking young man height air address all were unexceptionable and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father s he looked quick and sensible she felt immediately that she should like him and there was a well bred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be he had reached randalls the evening before she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan and travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half a day i told you yesterday cried mr weston with exultation i told you all that he would be here before the time named i remembered what i used to do myself one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far but in coming _ home _ i felt i might do any thing the word _ home _ made his father look on him with fresh complacency emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable the conviction was strengthened by what followed he was very much pleased with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house would hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation the walk to highbury highbury itself hartfield still more and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one s _ own _ country gives and the greatest curiosity to visit it that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously through emma s brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled his manner had no air of study or exaggeration he did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance on his side were the inquiries was she a horsewoman pleasant rides pleasant walks had they a large neighbourhood highbury perhaps afforded society enough there were several very pretty houses in and about it balls had they balls was it a musical society but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his mother in law and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs weston but undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter he understood what would be welcome he could be sure of little else his father s marriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor s merits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse s character than miss woodhouse miss taylor s and at last as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings said emma were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ i should listen with pleasure but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman i hope i should know better he replied no depend upon it with a gallant bow that in addressing mrs weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance she must see more of him to understand his ways at present she only felt they were agreeable she had no doubt of what mr weston was often thinking about his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening her own father s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them she blessed the favouring blindness he could now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest give way to all his natural kind hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr frank churchill s accommodation on his journey through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold which however he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night a reasonable visit paid mr weston began to move he must be going he had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands for mrs weston at ford s but he need not hurry any body else his son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also saying as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house though fairfax i believe is not the proper name i should rather say barnes or bates do you know any family of that name to be sure we do cried his father mrs bates we passed her house i saw miss bates at the window true true you are acquainted with miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine girl she is call upon her by all means there is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which oh go to day go to day do not defer it what is right to be done cannot be done too soon and besides i must give you a hint frank any want of attention to her _ here _ should be carefully avoided you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on if you do not call early it will be a slight the son looked convinced i have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma she is a very elegant young woman he agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it if you were never particularly struck by her manners before said she i think you will to day you will see her to advantage see her and hear her no i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you said mr woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street mr frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could and his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump they were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one and a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day with full confidence in their comfort chapter vi the next morning brought mr frank churchill again he came with mrs weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially he had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home till her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse their walk immediately fixed on highbury he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him he should always chuse the same highbury that airy cheerful happy looking highbury would be his constant attraction highbury with mrs weston stood for hartfield and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him they walked thither directly emma had hardly expected them for mr weston who had called in for half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in arm she was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in company with mrs weston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend if he were deficient there nothing should make amends for it but on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection and there was time enough for emma to form a reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning they were all three walking about together for an hour or two first round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards in highbury he was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently for mr woodhouse s ear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long and which had been the home of his father s father and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit they shewed altogether a good will towards highbury in general which must be very like a merit to those he was with emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making a parade of insincere professions and that mr knightley certainly had not done him justice their first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house though the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of post horses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built many years ago for a ball room and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used as such but such brilliant days had long passed away and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half gentlemen of the place he was immediately interested its character as a ball room caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge none which they suggested no it was long enough broad enough handsome enough it would hold the very number for comfort they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room she who could do any thing in highbury the want of proper families in the place and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied he could not be persuaded that so many good looking houses as he saw around him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting and even when particulars were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body s returning into their proper place the next morning he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills he seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe of pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference to a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind he could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap it was but an effusion of lively spirits at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged emma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had paid it yes oh yes he replied i was just going to mention it a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before and how did you think miss fairfax looking ill very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health a most deplorable want of complexion emma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss fairfax s complexion it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face he listened with all due deference acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same but yet he must confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health where features were indifferent a fine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good the effect was fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was well said emma there is no disputing about taste at least you admire her except her complexion he shook his head and laughed i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society at this moment they were approaching ford s and he hastily exclaimed ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ford s if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury i must buy something at ford s it will be taking out my freedom i dare say they sell gloves oh yes gloves and every thing i do admire your patriotism you will be adored in highbury you were very popular before you came because you were mr weston s son but lay out half a guinea at ford s and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues they went in and while the sleek well tied parcels of men s beavers and york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter he said but i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _ amor _ _ patriae _ do not let me lose it i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given her account i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her may i indeed then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well i met her frequently at weymouth i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly warm hearted woman i like them all you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be yes rather hesitatingly i believe i do you get upon delicate subjects emma said mrs weston smiling remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life i will move a little farther off i certainly do forget to think of _ her _ said emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment when the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play said frank churchill ever hear her repeated emma you forget how much she belongs to highbury i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began she plays charmingly you think so do you i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body s performance i have been used to hear her s admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof proof indeed said emma highly amused mr dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof certainly very strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if _ i _ had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me i could not excuse a man s having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it it was her very particular friend you know poor comfort said emma laughing one would rather have a stranger preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland you are right it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it so much the better or so much the worse i do not know which but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her quickness of friendship or dulness of feeling there was one person i think who must have felt it miss fairfax herself she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction as to that i do not oh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax s sensations from you or from any body else they are known to no human being i guess but herself but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends but we never did i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set and then her reserve i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved it is a most repulsive quality indeed said he oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater but i must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question i have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal he perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long and thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting he was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she had expected his ideas seemed more moderate his feelings warmer she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr elton s house which as well as the church he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much fault with no he could not believe it a bad house not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having if it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house there must be ample room in it for every real comfort the man must be a blockhead who wanted more mrs weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about used only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one but emma in her own mind determined that he _ did _ know what he was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper s room or a bad butler s pantry but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment chapter vii emma s very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day by hearing that he was gone off to london merely to have his hair cut a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast and he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to return to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve it did not accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense or even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday vanity extravagance love of change restlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs weston indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became liable to all these charges his father only called him a coxcomb and thought it a very good story but that mrs weston did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible and making no other comment than that all young people would have their little whims with the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him mrs weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether he appeared to have a very open temper certainly a very cheerful and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of him said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself and though there was no being attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect this was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him the honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near it and saved only by her own indifference for still her resolution held of never marrying the honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance mr weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must have some weight he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremely thought her very beautiful and very charming and with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him harshly as mrs weston observed all young people would have their little whims there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so leniently disposed in general he was judged throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury with great candour liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man one who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit among them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows or smiles mr knightley the circumstance was told him at hartfield for the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand hum just the trifling silly fellow i took him for she had half a mind to resent but an instant s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings and not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings mr and mrs weston s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune something occurred while they were at hartfield to make emma want their advice and which was still more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave this was the occurrence the coles had been settled some years in highbury and were very good sort of people friendly liberal and unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin in trade and only moderately genteel on their first coming into the country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means the house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them with their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company they added to their house to their number of servants to their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune and style of living second only to the family at hartfield their love of society and their new dining room prepared every body for their keeping dinner company and a few parties chiefly among the single men had already taken place the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite neither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls nothing should tempt _ her _ to go if they did and she regretted that her father s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish the coles were very respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them this lesson she very much feared they would receive only from herself she had little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her very differently affected donwell and randalls had received their invitation and none had come for her father and herself and mrs weston s accounting for it with i suppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out was not quite sufficient she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred again and again she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence might not the evening end in a dance had been a question of his the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits and her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment was but poor comfort it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her first remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful she owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely without inclination for the party the coles expressed themselves so properly there was so much real attention in the manner of it so much consideration for her father they would have solicited the honour earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a folding screen from london which they hoped might keep mr woodhouse from any draught of air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company upon the whole she was very persuadable and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort how certainly mrs goddard if not mrs bates might be depended on for bearing him company mr woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spending the whole evening away from him as for _ his _ going emma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late and the party too numerous he was soon pretty well resigned i am not fond of dinner visiting said he i never was no more is emma late hours do not agree with us i am sorry mr and mrs cole should have done it i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with us take us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you will both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy then turning to mrs weston with a look of gentle reproach ah miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me well sir cried mr weston as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it but the idea of any thing to be done in a _ moment _ was increasing not lessening mr woodhouse s agitation the ladies knew better how to allay it mr weston must be quiet and every thing deliberately arranged with this treatment mr woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual he should be happy to see mrs goddard he had a great regard for mrs goddard and emma should write a line and invite her james could take the note but first of all there must be an answer written to mrs cole you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible you will say that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my _ compliments _ of course but you will do every thing right i need not tell you what is to be done we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday i shall have no fears for you with him we have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour you will not like staying late you will get very tired when tea is over but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa oh no my love but you will soon be tired there will be a great many people talking at once you will not like the noise but my dear sir cried mr weston if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party and no great harm if it does said mr woodhouse the sooner every party breaks up the better but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are good natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought of than any other person s in the room you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious mr cole is very bilious no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends oh yes papa i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account i am only afraid of your sitting up for me i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort you must promise me not to sit up he did on the condition of some promises on her side such as that if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly if hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid should sit up for her and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house as usual chapter viii frank churchill came back again and if he kept his father s dinner waiting it was not known at hartfield for mrs weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr woodhouse to betray any imperfection which could be concealed he came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with a very good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done he had no reason to wish his hair longer to conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent to improve his spirits he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever and after seeing him emma thus moralised to herself i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly it depends upon the character of those who handle it mr knightley he is _ not _ a trifling silly young man if he were he would have done this differently he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again and for a longer time than hitherto of judging of his general manners and by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air and of fancying what the observations of all those might be who were now seeing them together for the first time she meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at mr cole s and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr cole her father s comfort was amply secured mrs bates as well as mrs goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty before she left the house was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all the amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling self denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal she had provided a plentiful dinner for them she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it she followed another carriage to mr cole s door and was pleased to see that it was mr knightley s for mr knightley keeping no horses having little spare money and a great deal of health activity and independence was too apt in emma s opinion to get about as he could and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out this is coming as you should do said she like a gentleman i am quite glad to see you he thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing room i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner yes i should i am sure i should there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them you think you carry it off very well i dare say but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances _ now _ you have nothing to try for you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed you are not striving to look taller than any body else _ now _ i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you nonsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr knightley she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated by her and as she firmly believed not without some dexterity on his side the party was rather large as it included one other family a proper unobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance and the male part of mr cox s family the lawyer of highbury the less worthy females were to come in the evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general and while politics and mr elton were talked over emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was the name of jane fairfax mrs cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting she listened and found it well worth listening to that very dear part of emma her fancy received an amusing supply mrs cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte a very elegant looking instrument not a grand but a large sized square pianoforte and the substance of the story the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry and congratulations on her side and explanations on miss bates s was that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood s the day before to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece entirely unexpected that at first by miss bates s account jane herself was quite at a loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it but now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter of course it must be from colonel campbell one can suppose nothing else added mrs cole and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present they might chuse to surprize her mrs cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way and still listen to mrs cole i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with i was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs cole s turned to frank churchill why do you smile said she nay why do you me i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell s being so rich and so liberal it is a handsome present very i rather wonder that it was never made before perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs bates s house you may _ say _ what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your _ thoughts _ on this subject are very much like mine i do not know i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question if colonel campbell is not the person who can be what do you say to mrs dixon mrs dixon very true indeed i had not thought of mrs dixon she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s it is mrs dixon i dare say i told you that your suspicions would guide mine if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _ mr _ dixon in them mr dixon very well yes i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr and mrs dixon we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained before i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with _ her _ or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excuse in the summer it might have passed but what can any body s native air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in her s i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are and upon my word they have an air of great probability mr dixon s preference of her music to her friend s i can answer for being very decided and then he saved her life did you ever hear of that a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard he caught her he did i was there one of the party were you really well but you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you if i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught her it was the work of a moment and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries the conversation was here interrupted they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored emma said the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells no i am sure it is not from the campbells miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr dixon is a principal in the business indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love there was no occasion to press the matter farther the conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it she said no more other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other nothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes the ladies had not been long in the drawing room before the other ladies in their different divisions arrived emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection there she sat and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding to be in company nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour jane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with harriet very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved yes of having loved even mr elton in vain by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance but by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend colonel campbell mrs weston kind hearted and musical was particularly interested by the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask and to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the fair heroine s countenance they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the early was frank churchill in he walked the first and the handsomest and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle where sat miss woodhouse and till he could find a seat by her would not sit at all emma divined what every body present must be thinking she was his object and every body must perceive it she introduced him to her friend miss smith and at convenient moments afterwards heard what each thought of the other he had never seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her naïveté and she only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment but she did think there were some looks a little like mr elton emma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room hated sitting long was always the first to move when he could that his father mr knightley mr cox and mr cole were left very busy over parish business that as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogether thought it so abundant in agreeable families that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe and the sort and could make out from his answers that as far as enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings were among a range of great families none very near and that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even chance that mrs churchill were not in health and spirits for going that they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address _ at _ _ times _ that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance for a night she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury taken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked his importance at enscombe was very evident he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could _ with _ _ time _ persuade her to any thing one of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned he had wanted very much to go abroad had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel but she would not hear of it this had happened the year before _ now _ he said he was beginning to have no longer the same wish the unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father i have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause i have been here a week to morrow half my time i never knew days fly so fast a week to morrow and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others i hate the recollection perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be seen the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to mr cole when mr cole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite what is the matter said she he started thank you for rousing me he replied i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that i cannot keep my eyes from her i never saw any thing so outrée those curls this must be a fancy of her own i see nobody else looking like her i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i yes i will i declare i will and you shall see how she takes it whether she colours he was gone immediately and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing before he could return to his chair it was taken by mrs weston this is the luxury of a large party said she one can get near every body and say every thing my dear emma i am longing to talk to you i have been making discoveries and forming plans just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh do you know how miss bates and her niece came here how they were invited were not they oh yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming they walked i conclude how else could they come very true well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now and as i looked at her though i never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure nobody was ever so fortunate as herself but with many many thanks there was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightley s carriage had brought and was to take them home again i was quite surprized very glad i am sure but really quite surprized such a very kind attention and so thoughtful an attention the sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them very likely said emma nothing more likely i know no man more likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thing to do any thing really good natured useful considerate or benevolent he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering jane fairfax s ill health would appear a case of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley i know he had horses to day for we arrived together and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray well said mrs weston smiling you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again the more i think of it the more probable it appears in short i have made a match between mr knightley and jane fairfax see the consequence of keeping you company what do you say to it mr knightley and jane fairfax exclaimed emma dear mrs weston how could you think of such a thing mr knightley mr knightley must not marry you would not have little henry cut out from donwell oh no no henry must have donwell i cannot at all consent to mr knightley s marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely i am amazed that you should think of such a thing my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it i do not want the match i do not want to injure dear little henry but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henry s account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter yes i would i could not bear to have henry supplanted mr knightley marry no i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now and jane fairfax too of all women nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well know but the imprudence of such a match i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention his good nature his humanity as i tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses he has a great regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax and is always glad to shew them attention my dear mrs weston do not take to match making you do it very ill jane fairfax mistress of the abbey oh no no every feeling revolts for his own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing imprudent if you please but not mad excepting inequality of fortune and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable but mr knightley does not want to marry i am sure he has not the least idea of it do not put it into his head why should he marry he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brother s children he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax nonsense he does not care about jane fairfax in the way of love i am sure he does not he would do any good to her or her family but well said mrs weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane such a respectable home if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him to have her haunting the abbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane so very kind and obliging but he always had been such a very kind neighbour and then fly off through half a sentence to her mother s old petticoat not that it was such a very old petticoat either for still it would last a great while and indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong for shame emma do not mimic her you divert me against my conscience and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates little things do not irritate him she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does i have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her his anxiety about her health his concern that she should have no happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells may it not be from mr knightley i cannot help suspecting him i think he is just the person to do it even without being in love then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do mr knightley does nothing mysteriously i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner you take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have many a time reproached me with doing i see no sign of attachment i believe nothing of the pianoforte and proof only shall convince me that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax they combated the point some time longer in the same way emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs weston was the most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation and at the same moment mr cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs weston she had been seeing nothing except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax followed mr cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as in every respect it suited emma best to lead she gave a very proper compliance she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany her own voice well one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize a second slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual followed he was accused of having a delightful voice and a perfect knowledge of music which was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter and had no voice at all roundly asserted they sang together once more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own with mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument to listen frank churchill sang again they had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth but the sight of mr knightley among the most attentive soon drew away half emma s mind and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs weston s suspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions her objections to mr knightley s marrying did not in the least subside she could see nothing but evil in it it would be a great disappointment to mr john knightley consequently to isabella a real injury to the children a most mortifying change and material loss to them all a very great deduction from her father s daily comfort and as to herself she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey a mrs knightley for them all to give way to no mr knightley must never marry little henry must remain the heir of donwell presently mr knightley looked back and came and sat down by her they talked at first only of the performance his admiration was certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs weston it would not have struck her as a sort of touchstone however she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put to for such a purpose quite out of the question quite out of the question he replied but you must often wish it i am sure and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step this present from the campbells said she this pianoforte is very kindly given yes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment but they would have done better had they given her notice of it surprizes are foolish things the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment whether there were no actual preference remained a little longer doubtful towards the end of jane s second song her voice grew thick that will do said he when it was hed thinking aloud you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet another song however was soon begged for one more they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling the strength of the song falls on the second mr knightley grew angry that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice this must not be and touching miss bates who at that moment passed near miss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere they have no mercy on her miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing originating nobody exactly knew where was so effectually promoted by mr and mrs cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space mrs weston capital in her country dances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr knightley this would be a trial he was no dancer in general if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something there was no immediate appearance no he was talking to mrs cole he was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else and he was still talking to mrs cole emma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment not more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a partner they were a couple worth looking at two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed it was growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home on her mother s account after some attempts therefore to be permitted to begin again they were obliged to thank mrs weston look sorrowful and have done perhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma to her carriage i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after yours chapter ix emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity she must have delighted the coles worthy people who deserved to be made happy and left a name behind her that would not soon die away perfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were two points on which she was not quite easy she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfax s feelings to frank churchill it was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax and there she had no doubt she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half she was then interrupted by harriet s coming in and if harriet s praise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted oh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax don t class us together harriet my playing is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshine oh dear i think you play the best of the two i think you play quite as well as she does i am sure i had much rather hear you every body last night said how well you played those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfax s is much beyond it well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution ah but jane fairfax has them both harriet are you sure i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any taste nobody talked about it and i hate italian singing there is no understanding a word of it besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family how did you think the coxes looked just as they always do very vulgar they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its producing mr elton they told me that mr martin dined with them last saturday oh he came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to dinner oh they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox i do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there he sat by her at dinner miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him very likely i think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in highbury harriet had business at ford s emma thought it most prudent to go with her another accidental meeting with the martins was possible and in her present state would be dangerous harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always very long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusement much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury mr perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting himself in at the office door mr cole s carriage horses returning from exercise or a stray letter boy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling children round the baker s little bow window eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door a mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see nothing that does not answer she looked down the randalls road the scene enlarged two persons appeared mrs weston and her son in law they were walking into highbury to hartfield of course they were stopping however in the first place at mrs bates s whose house was a little nearer randalls than ford s and had all but knocked when emma caught their eye immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterday s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting mrs weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses in order to hear the new instrument for my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised miss bates last night that i would come this morning i was not aware of it myself i did not know that i had fixed a day but as he says i did i am going now and while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope said frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfield if you are going home mrs weston was disappointed i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased me i should be quite in the way but perhaps i may be equally in the way here miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping she says i fidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same what am i to do i am here on no business of my own said emma i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument well if you advise it but with a smile if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood i do not believe any such thing replied emma i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfax s opinion last night do come with me said mrs weston if it be not very disagreeable to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterwards we will follow them to hartfield i really wish you to call with me it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you meant it he could say no more and with the hope of hartfield to reward him returned with mrs weston to mrs bates s door emma watched them in and then joined harriet at the interesting counter trying with all the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon be it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern at last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel should i send it to mrs goddard s ma am asked mrs ford yes no yes to mrs goddard s only my pattern gown is at hartfield no you shall send it to hartfield if you please but then mrs goddard will want to see it and i could take the pattern gown home any day but i shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to hartfield at least the ribbon you could make it into two parcels mrs ford could not you it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels no more it is no trouble in the world ma am said the obliging mrs ford oh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one then if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddard s i do not know no i think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night what do you advise that you do not give another half second to the subject to hartfield if you please mrs ford aye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddard s voices approached the shop or rather one voice and two ladies mrs weston and miss bates met them at the door my dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith how do you do miss smith very well i thank you and i begged mrs weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are very well i am much obliged to you my mother is delightfully well and jane caught no cold last night how is mr woodhouse i am so glad to hear such a good account mrs weston told me you were here oh then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother will be so very happy to see her and now we are such a nice party she cannot refuse aye pray do said mr frank churchill miss woodhouse s opinion of the instrument will be worth having but said i i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me oh said he wait half a minute till i have hed my job for would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my mother s spectacles the rivet came out you know this morning so very obliging for my mother had no use of her spectacles could not put them on and by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed jane said so i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing then another there is no saying what you know at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping oh said i patty do not come with your bad news to me here is the rivet of your mistress s spectacles out then the baked apples came home mrs wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and obliging to us the wallises always i have heard some people say that mrs wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them and it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know only three of us besides dear jane at present and she really eats nothing makes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it i dare not let my mother know how little she eats so i say one thing and then i say another and it passes off but about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry i happened to meet him in the street not that i had any doubt before i have so often heard mr woodhouse recommend a baked apple i believe it is the only way that mr woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome we have apple dumplings however very often patty makes an excellent apple dumpling well mrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will oblige us emma would be very happy to wait on mrs bates c and they did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss bates than how do you do mrs ford i beg your pardon i did not see you before i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town jane came back delighted yesterday thank ye the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in what was i talking of said she beginning again when they were all in the street emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of oh my mother s spectacles so very obliging of mr frank churchill oh said he i do think i can fasten the rivet i like a job of this kind excessively which you know shewed him to be so very indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly he seems every thing the fondest parent could oh said he i can fasten the rivet i like a job of that sort excessively i never shall forget his manner and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some oh said he directly there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finest looking home baked apples i ever saw in my life that you know was so very and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from donwell some of mr knightley s most liberal supply he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees i believe there is two of them my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days but i was really quite shocked the other day for mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock i am sure you must be said he and i will send you another supply for i have a great many more than i can ever use william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year i will send you some more before they get good for nothing so i begged he would not for really as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left it was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with me no i should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of _ that _ sort his master had he had brought them all and now his master had not one left to bake or boil william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his master s profit than any thing but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple tart this spring he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed i would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for the world he would be so very i wanted to keep it from jane s knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was aware miss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good will pray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase rather darker and narrower than one could wish miss smith pray take care miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you hit your foot miss smith the step at the turning chapter x the appearance of the little sitting room as they entered was tranquillity itself mrs bates deprived of her usual employment slumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table near her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again this is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated you find me trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed what said mrs weston have not you hed it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate i have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe you see we have been wedging one leg with paper this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home he contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again that she was not immediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance and emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to mrs weston had been delighted before and was delighted again emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill with a smile at emma the person has not chosen ill i heard a good deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and _ all _ _ that _ _ party _ would particularly prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself do not you think so jane did not look round she was not obliged to hear mrs weston had been speaking to her at the same moment it is not fair said emma in a whisper mine was a random guess do not distress her he shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy soon afterwards he began again how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion miss fairfax i dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instrument s coming to hand do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences he paused she could not but hear she could not avoid answering till i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice of forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence it must be all conjecture conjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at all your real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word miss fairfax said something about conjecturing there it is done i have the pleasure madam to mrs bates of restoring your spectacles healed for the present he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night let me live them over again you did not enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time i believe you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds all the worlds one ever has to give for another half hour she played what felicity it is to hear a tune again which _ has _ made one happy if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something else he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning to emma said here is something quite new to me do you know it cramer and here are a new set of irish melodies that from such a quarter one might expect this was all sent with the instrument very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not it he knew miss fairfax could have no music here i honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart nothing hastily done nothing incomplete true affection only could have prompted it emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her this amiable upright perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together emma took the opportunity of whispering you speak too plain she must understand you i hope she does i would have her understand me i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways leave shame to her if she does wrong she ought to feel it she is not entirely without it i think i do not see much sign of it she is playing _ robin _ _ adair _ at this moment _ his _ favourite shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window descried mr knightley on horse back not far off mr knightley i declare i must speak to him if possible just to thank him i will not open the window here it would give you all cold but i can go into my mother s room you know i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here quite delightful to have you all meet so our little room so honoured she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called mr knightley s attention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment how d ye do how d ye do very well i thank you so obliged to you for the carriage last night we were just in time my mother just ready for us pray come in do come in you will find some friends here so began miss bates and mr knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say how is your niece miss bates i want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece how is miss fairfax i hope she caught no cold last night how is she to day tell me how miss fairfax is and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else the listeners were amused and mrs weston gave emma a look of particular meaning but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism so obliged to you so very much obliged to you for the carriage resumed miss bates he cut her short with i am going to kingston can i do any thing for you oh dear kingston are you mrs cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston mrs cole has servants to send can i do any thing for _ you _ no i thank you but do come in who do you think is here miss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte do put up your horse at the crown and come in well said he in a deliberating manner for five minutes perhaps and here is mrs weston and mr frank churchill too quite delightful so many friends no not now i thank you i could not stay two minutes i must get on to kingston as fast as i can oh do come in they will be so very happy to see you no no your room is full enough i will call another day and hear the pianoforte well i am so sorry oh mr knightley what a delightful party last night how extremely pleasant did you ever see such dancing was not it delightful miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill i never saw any thing equal to it oh very delightful indeed i can say nothing less for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too i think miss fairfax dances very well and mrs weston is the very best country dance player without exception in england now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return but i cannot stay to hear it oh mr knightley one moment more something of consequence so shocked jane and i are both so shocked about the apples what is the matter now to think of your sending us all your store apples you said you had a great many and now you have not one left we really are so shocked mrs hodges may well be angry william larkins mentioned it here you should not have done it indeed you should not ah he is off he never can bear to be thanked but i thought he would have staid now and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned well returning to the room i have not been able to succeed mr knightley cannot stop he is going to kingston he asked me if he could do any thing yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing oh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud you must have heard every thing to be sure can i do any thing for you at kingston said he so i just mentioned oh miss woodhouse must you be going you seem but just come so very obliging of you emma found it really time to be at home the visit had already lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that mrs weston and her companion taking leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls chapter xi it may be possible to do without dancing entirely instances have been known of young people passing many many months successively without being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue either to body or mind but when a beginning is made when the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly felt it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again and the last half hour of an evening which mr woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject frank s was the first idea and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax and even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aids of vanity to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr weston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest his first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr cole s should be hed there that the same party should be collected and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence mr weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and mrs weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five had been repeated many times over and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room but soon it came to be on one side but will there be good room for five couple i really do not think there will on another and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it it will not do to _ invite _ five couple it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment somebody said that _ miss _ gilbert was expected at her brother s and must be invited with the rest somebody else believed _ mrs _ gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had been asked a word was put in for a second young cox and at last mr weston naming one family of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other might not they use both rooms and dance across the passage it seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better emma said it would be awkward mrs weston was in distress about the supper and mr woodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of health it made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in oh no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong she would catch a dreadful cold so would poor little harriet so you would all mrs weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them talk of it that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately he does not think of the draught i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing mrs weston was sorry for such a charge she knew the importance of it and said every thing in her power to do it away every door was now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again and with such good will on frank churchill s part that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten we were too magnificent said he we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well emma demurred it would be a crowd a sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in very true he gravely replied it was very bad but still he went on measuring and still he ended with i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple no no said she you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room there is no denying it he replied i agree with you exactly a crowd in a little room miss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words exquisite quite exquisite still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up it would be a disappointment to my father and altogether i do not know that i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self willed and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave the rest had she intended ever to _ marry _ him it might have been worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference and the character of his temper but for all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my father s little rooms i bring a new proposal on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your approbation to be acted upon may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn the crown yes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls it is his own idea mrs weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied this is what we all feel oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferable dreadful i felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield is not it a good exchange you consent i hope you consent it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully comprehended and then being quite new farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable no he thought it very far from an improvement a very bad plan much worse than the other a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited if they must dance they had better dance at randalls he had never been in the room at the crown in his life did not know the people who kept it by sight oh no a very bad plan they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere i was going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body s catching cold so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could sir said mr woodhouse rather warmly you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s house from the very circumstance of its being larger sir we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all not once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief open the windows but surely mr churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls nobody could be so imprudent i never heard of such a thing dancing with open windows i am sure neither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it ah sir but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window curtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected i have often known it done myself have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done but unfortunately sir my time is so limited oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles if _ miss _ _ taylor _ undertakes to wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perry s great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones have the measles she will send for perry my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment said frank churchill examining the capabilities of the house i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot i was desired to say so from both it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there they can do nothing satisfactorily without you emma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young people set off together without delay for the crown there were mr and mrs weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and very happy in their different way she in some little distress and he finding every thing perfect emma said she this paper is worse than i expected look in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined my dear you are too particular said her husband what does all that signify you will see nothing of it by candlelight it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight we never see any thing of it on our club nights the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never know when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain it regarded a supper room at the time of the ballroom s being built suppers had not been in question and a small card room adjoining was the only addition what was to be done this card room would be wanted as a card room now or if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable supper another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it this made a difficulty mrs weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper mrs weston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches c set out in the little room but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion a private dance without sitting down to supper was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women and mrs weston must not speak of it again she then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed i do not think it _ is _ so very small we shall not be many you know and mr weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through the passage was calling out you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs i wish said mrs weston one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be yes very true cried frank very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us well if you please said mrs weston rather hesitating if you think she will be of any use you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in consulting miss bates but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk and i need not bring the whole family you know here mr weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it his decided approbation aye do frank go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at once she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties fetch miss bates we are growing a little too nice she is a standing lesson of how to be happy but fetch them both invite them both both sir can the old lady the old lady no the young lady to be sure i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece oh i beg your pardon sir i did not immediately recollect undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both and away he ran long before he reappeared attending the short neat brisk moving aunt and her elegant niece mrs weston like a sweet tempered woman and a good wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before indeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision all the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth all the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs weston and mrs stokes every body invited was certainly to come frank had already written to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight which could not possibly be refused and a delightful dance it was to be most cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must as a counsellor she was not wanted but as an approver a much safer character she was truly welcome her approbation at once general and minute warm and incessant could not but please and for another half hour they were all walking to and fro between the different rooms some suggesting some attending and all in happy enjoyment of the future the party did not break up without emma s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing mr weston whisper to his wife he has asked her my dear that s right i knew he would chapter xii one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill s stay in surry for in spite of mr weston s confidence she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight but this was not judged feasible the preparations must take their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they must be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertainty at the risk in her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain enscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word his wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was not opposed all was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another emma being now certain of her ball began to adopt as the next vexation mr knightley s provoking indifference about it either because he did not dance himself or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording him any future amusement to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply than very well if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me oh yes i must be there i could not refuse and i will keep as much awake as i can but i would rather be at home looking over william larkins s week s account much rather i confess pleasure in seeing dancing not i indeed i never look at it i do not know who does fine dancing i believe like virtue must be its own reward those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different this emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by _ her _ feelings in reprobating the ball for _ she _ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree it made her animated open hearted she voluntarily said oh miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball what a disappointment it would be i do look forward to it i own with _ very _ great pleasure it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins no she was more and more convinced that mrs weston was quite mistaken in that surmise there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side but no love alas there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over throw of every thing a letter arrived from mr churchill to urge his nephew s instant return mrs churchill was unwell far too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note from mrs weston instantly as to his going it was inevitable he must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance he knew her illnesses they never occurred but for her own convenience mrs weston added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon this wretched note was the finale of emma s breakfast when once it had been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim the loss of the ball the loss of the young man and all that the young man might be feeling it was too wretched such a delightful evening as it would have been every body so happy and she and her partner the happiest i said it would be so was the only consolation her father s feelings were quite distinct he thought principally of mrs churchill s illness and wanted to know how she was treated and as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed but they would all be safer at home emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared but if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it his dejection was most evident he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say of all horrid things leave taking is the worst but you will come again said emma this will not be your only visit to randalls ah shaking his head the uncertainty of when i may be able to return i shall try for it with a zeal it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring but i am afraid they did not stir last spring i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever our poor ball must be quite given up ah that ball why did we wait for any thing why not seize the pleasure at once how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation you told us it would be so oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance i would much rather have been merry than wise if i can come again we are still to have our ball my father depends on it do not forget your engagement emma looked graciously such a fortnight as it has been he continued every day more precious and more delightful than the day before every day making me less fit to bear any other place happy those who can remain at highbury as you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first do not we rather surpass your expectations i am sure we do i am sure you did not much expect to like us you would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury he laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment emma was convinced that it had been so and you must be off this very morning yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and i must be off immediately i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates how unlucky miss bates s powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours yes i _ have _ called there passing the door i thought it better it was a right thing to do i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss bates s being absent she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may that one _ must _ laugh at but that one would not wish to slight it was better to pay my visit then he hesitated got up walked to a window in short said he perhaps miss woodhouse i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts she hardly knew what to say it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious which she did not wish forcing herself to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then he was silent she believed he was looking at her probably reflecting on what she had said and trying to understand the manner she heard him sigh it was natural for him to feel that he had _ cause _ to sigh he could not believe her to be encouraging him a few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and in a more determined manner said it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield my regard for hartfield is most warm he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed he was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance mr woodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made him composed a very few minutes more however completed the present trial mr weston always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that was doubtful said it was time to go and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree to take leave i shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you i have engaged mrs weston to correspond with me she has been so kind as to promise it oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really interested in the absent she will tell me every thing in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again a very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest good bye closed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill short had been the notice short their meeting he was gone and emma felt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too much it was a sad change they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks indescribable spirit the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners it had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days to complete every other recommendation he had _ almost _ told her that he loved her what strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to was another point but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself and this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that she _ must _ be a little in love with him in spite of every previous determination against it i certainly must said she this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not for a few weeks at least well evil to some is always good to others i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes mr knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness he could not say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable kindness added you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck it was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet her composure was odious she had been particularly unwell however suffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare that had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have attended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill health chapter xiii emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love her ideas only varied as to the how much at first she thought it was a good deal and afterwards but little she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr and mrs weston she was very often thinking of him and quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring but on the other hand she could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed for employment than usual she was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _ refused _ _ him _ their affection was always to subside into friendship every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting but still they were to part when she became sensible of this it struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father never to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings i do not find myself making any use of the word _ sacrifice _ said she in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to making a sacrifice i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness so much the better i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do i am quite enough in love i should be sorry to be more upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings _ he _ is undoubtedly very much in love every thing denotes it very much in love indeed and when he comes again if his affection continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been different still however i must be on my guard this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy his feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved i shall do very well again after a little while and then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall have been let off easily when his letter to mrs weston arrived emma had the perusal of it and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had undervalued their strength it was a long well written letter giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the language of real feeling towards mrs weston and the transition from highbury to enscombe the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety the charm of her own name was not wanting _ miss _ _ woodhouse _ appeared more than once and never without a something of pleasing connexion either a compliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said and in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words i had not a spare moment on tuesday as you know for miss woodhouse s beautiful little friend pray make my excuses and adieus to her this emma could not doubt was all for herself harriet was remembered only from being _ her _ friend his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated mrs churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for coming to randalls again gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned to mrs weston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her her intentions were unchanged her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness his recollection of harriet and the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the idea of harriet s succeeding her in his affections was it impossible no harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour for harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed i must not dwell upon it said she i must not think of it i know the danger of indulging such speculations but stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet s behalf though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil in that quarter was at hand as frank churchill s arrival had succeeded mr elton s engagement in the conversation of highbury as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now upon frank churchill s disappearance mr elton s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form his wedding day was named he would soon be among them again mr elton and his bride there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before mr elton and his bride was in every body s mouth and frank churchill was forgotten emma grew sick at the sound she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr elton and harriet s mind she had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength with mr weston s ball in view at least there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach new carriage bell ringing and all poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give emma felt that she could not do too much for her that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions the same harriet listened submissively and said it was very true it was just as miss woodhouse described it was not worth while to think about them and she would not think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and the next half hour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before at last emma attacked her on another ground your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make _ me _ you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it i assure you deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation emma continued i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i have been pressing on you they are very important and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse whom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while and when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been such expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well nor valued her affection so highly before there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to herself there is nothing to be compared to it warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved which gives isabella all her popularity i have it not but i know how to prize and respect it harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives dear harriet i would not change you for the clearest headed longest sighted best judging female breathing oh the coldness of a jane fairfax harriet is worth a hundred such and for a wife a sensible man s wife it is invaluable i mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet chapter xiv mrs elton was first seen at church but though devotion might be interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty or not pretty at all emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of harriet s going with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible she could not enter the house again could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to lace up her boot without _ recollecting _ a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur compliments charades and horrible blunders and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent the visit was of course short and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the nothing meaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing she did not really like her she would not be in a hurry to find fault but she suspected that there was no elegance ease but not elegance she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there was too much ease her person was rather good her face not unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant emma thought at least it would turn out so as for mr elton his manners did not appear but no she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it the woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes and the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own good sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly and as little really easy as could be well miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted the house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin well miss woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her is not she very charming there was a little hesitation in emma s answer oh yes very a very pleasing young woman i think her beautiful quite beautiful very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love oh no there is nothing to surprize one at all a pretty fortune and she came in his way i dare say returned harriet sighing again i dare say she was very much attached to him perhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have yes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again he is just as superior as ever but being married you know it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves happy creature he called her augusta how delightful when the visit was returned emma made up her mind she could then see more and judge better from harriet s happening not to be at hartfield and her father s being present to engage mr elton she had a quarter of an hour of the lady s conversation to herself and could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs elton was a vain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance that she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which had been formed in a bad school pert and familiar that all her notions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living that if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would certainly do mr elton no good harriet would have been a better match if not wise or refined herself she would have connected him with those who were but miss hawkins it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best of her own set the rich brother in law near bristol was the pride of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother mr suckling s seat a comparison of hartfield to maple grove the grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty and the house was modern and well built mrs elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or imagine very like maple grove indeed she was quite struck by the likeness that room was the very shape and size of the morning room at maple grove her sister s favourite room mr elton was appealed to was not it astonishingly like she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove and the staircase you know as i came in i observed how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house i really could not help exclaiming i assure you miss woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove i have spent so many happy months there with a little sigh of sentiment a charming place undoubtedly every body who sees it is struck by its beauty but to me it has been quite a home whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony emma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient for mrs elton who only wanted to be talking herself so extremely like maple grove and it is not merely the house the grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand very much in the same way just across the lawn and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in mind my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style emma doubted the truth of this sentiment she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth while to attack an error so double dyed and therefore only said in reply when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties oh yes i am quite aware of that it is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry no i fancy not replied mrs elton with a most satisfied smile i never heard any county but surry called so emma was silenced my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest continued mrs elton and that will be our time for exploring while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say they will have their barouche landau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of _ our _ carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well they would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau it will be so very much preferable when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond of exploring we explored to king s weston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche landau you have many parties of that kind here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer no not immediately here we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort nobody can be more devoted to home than i am i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol i really cannot get this girl to move from the house i absolutely must go in by myself though i hate being stuck up in the barouche landau without a companion but augusta i believe with her own good will would never stir beyond the park paling many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse looking towards mr woodhouse your father s state of health must be a great drawback why does not he try bath indeed he should let me recommend bath to you i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr woodhouse good my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now ah that s a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give in my bath life i have seen such instances of it and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to mr woodhouse s spirits which i understand are sometimes much depressed and as to its recommendations to _ you _ i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite the idea of her being indebted to mrs elton for what was called an _ introduction _ of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs elton s probably some vulgar dashing widow who with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live the dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have given and only thanked mrs elton coolly but their going to bath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father and then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the subject directly i do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton upon these occasions a lady s character generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer oh no indeed i must protest against any such idea a superior performer very far from it i assure you consider from how partial a quarter your information came i am doatingly fond of music passionately fond and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is _ mediocre _ to the last degree you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got into i absolutely cannot do without music it is a necessary of life to me and having always been used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice i honestly said as much to mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house too knowing what i had been accustomed to of course he was not wholly without apprehension when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that _ the _ _ world _ i could give up parties balls plays for i had no fear of retirement blessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to _ me _ i could do very well without it to those who had no resources it was a different thing but my resources made me quite independent and as to smaller sized rooms than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments but said i to be quite honest i do not think i can live without something of a musical society i condition for nothing else but without music life would be a blank to me we cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _ very _ musical society in highbury and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head i am delighted to find myself in such a circle i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours will not it be a good plan if _ we _ exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _ me _ as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know there is a sad story against them in general they are but too apt to give up music but you who are so extremely fond of it there can be no danger surely i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance i tremble selina has entirely given up music never touches the instrument though she played sweetly and the same may be said of mrs jeffereys clara partridge that was and of the two milmans now mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright i used to be quite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper but every thing of that kind said emma will soon be in so regular a train well said mrs elton laughing we shall see emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and after a moment s pause mrs elton chose another subject we have been calling at randalls said she and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be i like them extremely mr weston seems an excellent creature quite a first rate favourite with me already i assure you and _ she _ appears so truly good there is something so motherly and kind hearted about her that it wins upon one directly she was your governess i think emma was almost too much astonished to answer but mrs elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very lady like but she is really quite the gentlewoman mrs weston s manners said emma were always particularly good their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman and who do you think came in while we were there emma was quite at a loss the tone implied some old acquaintance and how could she possibly guess knightley continued mrs elton knightley himself was not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr e s i had a great curiosity my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman like man happily it was now time to be gone they were off and emma could breathe insufferable woman was her immediate exclamation worse than i had supposed absolutely insufferable knightley i could not have believed it knightley never seen him in her life before and call him knightley and discover that he is a gentleman a little upstart vulgar being with her mr e and her _ caro _ _ sposo _ and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery actually to discover that mr knightley is a gentleman i doubt whether he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady i could not have believed it and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club one would fancy we were bosom friends and mrs weston astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman worse and worse i never met with her equal much beyond my hopes harriet is disgraced by any comparison oh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here how angry and how diverted he would be ah there i am thinking of him directly always the first person to be thought of how i catch myself out frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind all this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons departure and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too quick a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor however she seems a very obliging pretty behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife though i think he had better not have married i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i _ should _ in the course of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane i dare say your apologies were accepted sir mr elton knows you yes but a young lady a bride i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible it was being very deficient but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _ bride _ it ought to be no recommendation to _ you _ it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady and a bride especially is never to be neglected more is avowedly due to _ her _ a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies my dear you do not understand me this is a matter of mere common politeness and good breeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry emma had done her father was growing nervous and could not understand _ her _ her mind returned to mrs elton s offences and long very long did they occupy her chapter xv emma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill opinion of mrs elton her observation had been pretty correct such as mrs elton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared whenever they met again self important presuming familiar ignorant and ill bred she had a little beauty and a little accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as mrs elton s consequence only could surpass there was no reason to suppose mr elton thought at all differently from his wife he seemed not merely happy with her but proud he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury as not even miss woodhouse could equal and the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging following the lead of miss bates s good will or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied so that mrs elton s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed in one respect mrs elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first her feelings altered towards emma offended probably by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant and though the effect was agreeable the ill will which produced it was necessarily increasing emma s dislike her manners too and mr elton s were unpleasant towards harriet they were sneering and negligent emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet s cure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much it was not to be doubted that poor harriet s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own share in the story under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been given also she was of course the object of their joint dislike when they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet mrs elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax and from the first not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration but without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and befriend her before emma had forfeited her confidence and about the third time of their meeting she heard all mrs elton s knight errantry on the subject jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse i quite rave about jane fairfax a sweet interesting creature so mild and ladylike and with such talents i assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point oh she is absolutely charming you will laugh at my warmth but upon my word i talk of nothing but jane fairfax and her situation is so calculated to affect one miss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her we must bring her forward such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its fragrance on the desert air we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax i cannot think there is any danger of it was emma s calm answer and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax s situation and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs campbell i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown oh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end and i think she feels it i am sure she does she is very timid and silent one can see that she feels the want of encouragement i like her the better for it i must confess it is a recommendation to me i am a great advocate for timidity and i am sure one does not often meet with it but in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing oh i assure you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than i can express you appear to feel a great deal but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax s acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act you and i need not be afraid if _ we _ set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations _ we _ have carriages to fetch and convey her home and _ we _ live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked _ more _ than jane fairfax to partake of it i have no idea of that sort of thing it is not likely that i _ should _ considering what i have been used to my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling in income however my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax i shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties poor jane fairfax thought emma you have not deserved this you may have done wrong with regard to mr dixon but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited the kindness and protection of mrs elton jane fairfax and jane fairfax heavens let me not suppose that she dares go about emma woodhouse ing me but upon my honour there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman s tongue emma had not to listen to such paradings again to any so exclusively addressed to herself so disgustingly decorated with a dear miss woodhouse the change on mrs elton s side soon afterwards appeared and she was left in peace neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs elton nor under mrs elton s guidance the very active patroness of jane fairfax and only sharing with others in a general way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done she looked on with some amusement miss bates s gratitude for mrs elton s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth she was quite one of her worthies the most amiable affable delightful woman just as accomplished and condescending as mrs elton meant to be considered emma s only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs elton as she seemed to do she heard of her walking with the eltons sitting with the eltons spending a day with the eltons this was astonishing she could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer she is a riddle quite a riddle said she to chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort and now to chuse the mortification of mrs elton s notice and the penury of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real generous affection jane had come to highbury professedly for three months the campbells were gone to ireland for three months but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there according to miss bates it all came from her mrs dixon had written most pressingly would jane but go means were to be found servants sent friends contrived no travelling difficulty allowed to exist but still she had declined it she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing this invitation was emma s conclusion she must be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself there is great fear great caution great resolution somewhere she is _ not _ to be with the _ dixons _ the decree is issued by somebody but why must she consent to be with the eltons here is quite a separate puzzle upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject before the few who knew her opinion of mrs elton mrs weston ventured this apology for jane we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma but it is better than being always at home her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to you are right mrs weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her emma felt that mrs weston was giving her a momentary glance and she was herself struck by his warmth with a faint blush she presently replied such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting i should not wonder said mrs weston if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and after a few minutes silence he said another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk _ to _ miss fairfax as she speaks _ of _ her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness i know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma little henry was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say yes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stopping it was better however to know the worst at once she hurried on and yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other mr knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together or some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered oh are you there but you are miserably behindhand mr cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago he stopped emma felt her foot pressed by mrs weston and did not herself know what to think in a moment he went on that will never be however i can assure you miss fairfax i dare say would not have me if i were to ask her and i am very sure i shall never ask her emma returned her friend s pressure with interest and was pleased enough to exclaim you are not vain mr knightley i will say that for you he seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtful and in a manner which shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax no indeed i have not you have scolded me too much for match making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you what i said just now meant nothing one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning oh no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married mr knightley was thoughtful again the result of his reverie was no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize i never had a thought of her in that way i assure you and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming young woman but not even jane fairfax is perfect she has a fault she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault well said she and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose yes very soon he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley what can she do for mr cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her mrs weston your argument weighs most with me i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over mrs elton i have no faith in mrs elton s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau jane fairfax has feeling said mr knightley i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond well mrs weston said emma triumphantly when he left them what do you say now to mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me chapter xvi every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr elton was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage dinner parties and evening parties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day i see how it is said she i see what a life i am to lead among you upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated we really seem quite the fashion if this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a disengaged day a woman with fewer resources than i have need not have been at a loss no invitation came amiss to her her bath habits made evening parties perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at the poor attempt at rout cakes and there being no ice in the highbury card parties mrs bates mrs perry mrs goddard and others were a good deal behind hand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party in which her card tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons they must not do less than others or she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable of pitiful resentment a dinner there must be after emma had talked about it for ten minutes mr woodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him the persons to be invited required little thought besides the eltons it must be the westons and mr knightley so far it was all of course and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriet s begging to be allowed to decline it she would rather not be in his company more than she could help she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable if miss woodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home it was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it possible enough for wishing she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax since her last conversation with mrs weston and mr knightley she was more conscience stricken about jane fairfax than she had often been mr knightley s words dwelt with her he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs elton which nobody else paid her this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant and it is very shameful of the same age and always knowing her i ought to have been more her friend she will never like me now i have neglected her too long but i will shew her greater attention than i have done every invitation was successful they were all disengaged and all happy the preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over a circumstance rather unlucky occurred the two eldest little knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them and staying one whole day at hartfield which one day would be the very day of this party his professional engagements did not allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so mr woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear and here would be a ninth and emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty eight hours without falling in with a dinner party she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very immaterial she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother the event was more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma john knightley came but mr weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day he might be able to join them in the evening but certainly not to dinner mr woodhouse was quite at ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the chief of even emma s vexation the day came the party were punctually assembled and mr john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax mrs elton as elegant as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silence wanting only to observe enough for isabella s information but miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could talk to her he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he said i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i am sure you must have been wet we scarcely got home in time i hope you turned directly i went only to the post office said she and reached home before the rain was much it is my daily errand i always fetch the letters when i am here it saves trouble and is a something to get me out a walk before breakfast does me good not a walk in the rain i should imagine no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out mr john knightley smiled and replied that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for there was a little blush and then this answer i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters indifferent oh no i never conceived you could become indifferent letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship i have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does ah you are not serious now i know mr john knightley too well i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body i can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a post office i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to day when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years said john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings i consider one as including the other time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle but that is not the change i had in view for you as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have it was kindly said and very far from giving offence a pleasant thank you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip a tear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh her attention was now claimed by mr woodhouse who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with her and with all his mildest urbanity said i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain young ladies should take care of themselves young ladies are delicate plants they should take care of their health and their complexion my dear did you change your stockings yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for i hope your good grand mama and aunt are well they are some of my very old friends i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour you do us a great deal of honour to day i am sure my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield the kind hearted polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy by this time the walk in the rain had reached mrs elton and her remonstrances now opened upon jane my dear jane what is this i hear going to the post office in the rain this must not be i assure you you sad girl how could you do such a thing it is a sign i was not there to take care of you jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold oh do not tell _ me _ you really are a very sad girl and do not know how to take care of yourself to the post office indeed mrs weston did you ever hear the like you and i must positively exert our authority my advice said mrs weston kindly and persuasively i certainly do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year the spring i always think requires more than common care better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable you look as if you would not do such a thing again oh she _ shall _ _ not _ do such a thing again eagerly rejoined mrs elton we will not allow her to do such a thing again and nodding significantly there must be some arrangement made there must indeed i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you that will obviate all difficulties you know and from _ us _ i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation you are extremely kind said jane but i cannot give up my early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before my dear jane say no more about it the thing is determined that is laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master you know mrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled excuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant if the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am not here by my grandmama s oh my dear but so much as patty has to do and it is a kindness to employ our men jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead of answering she began speaking again to mr john knightley the post office is a wonderful establishment said she the regularity and despatch of it if one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing it is certainly very well regulated so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder the clerks grow expert from habit they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them if you want any farther explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it that is the key to a great deal of capacity the public pays and must be served well the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual observations made i have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart yes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness i know what you mean but emma s hand is the strongest isabella and emma both write beautifully said mr woodhouse and always did and so does poor mrs weston with half a sigh and half a smile at her i never saw any gentleman s handwriting emma began looking also at mrs weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs weston was attending to some one else and the pause gave her time to reflect now how am i going to introduce him am i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase your yorkshire friend your correspondent in yorkshire that would be the way i suppose if i were very bad no i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress i certainly get better and better now for it mrs weston was disengaged and emma began again mr frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw i do not admire it said mr knightley it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing this was not submitted to by either lady they vindicated him against the base aspersion no it by no means wanted strength it was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong had not mrs weston any letter about her to produce no she had heard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put it away if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writing desk i am sure i could produce a specimen i have a note of his do not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you one day he chose to say he was employed well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr knightley oh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill said mr knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best dinner was on table mrs elton before she could be spoken to was ready and before mr woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining parlour was saying must i go first i really am ashamed of always leading the way jane s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma she had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any she suspected that it _ had _ that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear and that it had not been in vain she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual a glow both of complexion and spirits she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mails it was at her tongue s end but she abstained she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfax s feelings and they followed the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance of good will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each chapter xvii when the ladies returned to the drawing room after dinner emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself she and mrs weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together mrs elton left them no choice if jane repressed her for a little time she soon began again and though much that passed between them was in a half whisper especially on mrs elton s side there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects the post office catching cold fetching letters and friendship were long under discussion and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant to jane inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her and professions of mrs elton s meditated activity here is april come said she i get quite anxious about you june will soon be here but i have never fixed on june or any other month merely looked forward to the summer in general but have you really heard of nothing i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing i not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs elton who can have thought of it as i have done but you have not seen so much of the world as i have you do not know how many candidates there always are for the _ first _ situations i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove a cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle wax candles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in colonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer said jane i must spend some time with them i am sure they will want it afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present trouble aye i know your scruples you are afraid of giving me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am i shall write to mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving any body trouble but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us your inexperience really amuses me a situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moment s notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly excuse me ma am but this is by no means my intention i make no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends when i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce something offices for the sale not quite of human flesh but of human intellect oh my dear human flesh you quite shock me if you mean a fling at the slave trade i assure you mr suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition i did not mean i was not thinking of the slave trade replied jane governess trade i assure you was all that i had in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where it lies but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do something that would do repeated mrs elton aye _ that _ may suit your humble ideas of yourself i know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life you are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications i think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison a gentleman s family is all that i should condition for i know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i shall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right to move in the first circle your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chose that is i do not know if you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure but you sing as well as play yes i really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you chose and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such a situation together said jane they are pretty sure to be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me i am exceedingly obliged to you mrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as i am and i am quite serious too i assure you replied mrs elton gaily in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us in this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change of object and emma heard her saying in the same half whisper to jane here comes this dear old beau of mine i protest only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men what a dear creature he is i assure you i like him excessively i admire all that quaint old fashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease modern ease often disgusts me but this good old mr woodhouse i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner oh i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous i fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown how do you like it selina s choice handsome i think but i do not know whether it is not over trimmed i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over trimmed quite a horror of finery i must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery but i am quite in the minority i believe few people seem to value simplicity of dress show and finery are every thing i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin do you think it will look well the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing room when mr weston made his appearance among them he had returned to a late dinner and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over he had been too much expected by the best judges for surprize but there was great joy mr woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now as he would have been sorry to see him before john knightley only was in mute astonishment that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london should set off again and walk half a mile to another man s house for the sake of being in mixed company till bed time of hing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply a man who had been in motion since eight o clock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alone such a man to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party john knightley looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said i could not have believed it even of _ him _ mr weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere from home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding to a family communication which though principally addressed to mrs weston he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room he gave her a letter it was from frank and to herself he had met with it in his way and had taken the liberty of opening it read it read it said he it will give you pleasure only a few lines will not take you long read it to emma the two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to every body well he is coming you see good news i think well what do you say to it i always told you he would be here again soon did not i anne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe me in town next week you see at the latest i dare say for _ she _ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there to morrow or saturday as to her illness all nothing of course but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again so near as town they will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us this is precisely what i wanted well pretty good news is not it have you hed it has emma read it all put it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way mrs weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion her looks and words had nothing to restrain them she was happy she knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy her congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak so fluently _ she _ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings and trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she rather thought was considerable mr weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already it was well that he took every body s joy for granted or he might not have thought either mr woodhouse or mr knightley particularly delighted they were the first entitled after mrs weston and emma to be made happy from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have been too positive an interruption and finding himself close to mrs elton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her chapter xviii i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you said mr weston mrs elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope smiled most graciously you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he continued and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage you are very obliging frank will be extremely happy i am sure he is to be in town next week if not sooner we have notice of it in a letter to day i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to mrs weston she is his principal correspondent i assure you i hardly ever get a letter and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston laughing affectedly i must protest against that a most dangerous precedent indeed i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves oh mr weston i could not have believed it of you aye we men are sad fellows you must take care of yourself mrs elton this letter tells us it is a short letter written in a hurry merely to give us notice it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on mrs churchill s account she has not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her so they are all to move southward without loss of time indeed from yorkshire i think enscombe is in yorkshire yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london a considerable journey yes upon my word very considerable sixty five miles farther than from maple grove to london but what is distance mr weston to people of large fortune you would be amazed to hear how my brother mr suckling sometimes flies about you will hardly believe me but twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again with four horses the evil of the distance from enscombe said mr weston is that mrs churchill _ as _ _ we _ _ understand _ has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together in frank s last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle s this you know speaks a great degree of weakness but now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the road so frank writes word certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs elton you must grant me that no indeed i shall grant you nothing i always take the part of my own sex i do indeed i give you notice you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point i always stand up for women and i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchill s making incredible exertions to avoid it selina says it is quite horror to her and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution does mrs churchill do the same depend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did mrs churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for mrs elton eagerly interposed with oh mr weston do not mistake me selina is no fine lady i assure you do not run away with such an idea is not she then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld mrs elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _ not _ a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it and she was considering in what way she had best retract when mr weston went on mrs churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect but this is quite between ourselves she is very fond of frank and therefore i would not speak ill of her besides she is out of health now but _ that _ indeed by her own account she has always been i would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much faith in mrs churchill s illness if she is really ill why not go to bath mr weston to bath or to clifton she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe she has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change it is a retired place a fine place but very retired aye like maple grove i dare say nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life i always say a woman cannot have too many resources and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society frank was here in february for a fortnight so i remember to have heard he will find an _ addition _ to the society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume to call myself an addition but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by and mr weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible not heard of you i believe mrs weston s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton he had done his duty and could return to his son when frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day s news doubly welcome it has been completely unexpected that is _ i _ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forth i always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next very true mr weston perfectly true it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _ may _ before hymen s saffron robe would be put on for us oh the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views the carriage we had disappointments about the carriage one morning i remember he came to me quite in despair she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and mr weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on you were mentioning may may is the very month which mrs churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombe in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended now will be the time this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house i think it is so i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy mrs weston s partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me she thinks nobody equal to him and i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour i have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchill at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of him i am no flatterer mr weston was musing i hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor mrs churchill if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she was the instigator frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife s his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart only think well that must be infinitely provoking i have quite a horror of upstarts maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves your description of mrs churchill made me think of them directly people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows they came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know mr weston one has not great hopes from birmingham i always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things i assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother mr suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours it is infinitely too bad mr suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove and whose father had it before him i believe at least i am almost sure that old mr suckling had completed the purchase before his death they were interrupted tea was carrying round and mr weston having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away after tea mr and mrs weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhouse to cards the remaining five were left to their own powers and emma doubted their getting on very well for mr knightley seemed little disposed for conversation mrs elton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent mr john knightley proved more talkative than his brother he was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys but you have your sister s letter and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure my charge would be much more concise than her s and probably not much in the same spirit all that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them i rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again that is very likely you think so do not you i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately increase certainly you must be sensible that the last half year has made a great difference in your way of life difference no indeed i am not there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be witness this very time here am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner party when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it a little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr cole s or balls at the crown the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goings on is very great yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all very well and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are i only beg you to send them home no cried mr knightley that need not be the consequence let them be sent to donwell i shall certainly be at leisure upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine what have they been dining once with the coles and having a ball talked of which never took place i can understand you nodding at mr john knightley your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed but you turning to mr knightley who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts mr knightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded without difficulty upon mrs elton s beginning to talk to him volume iii chapter i a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing it was not worth thinking of but if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away it would be very distressing if a separation of two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils before her caution for him and for herself would be necessary she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state it was not very long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill s feelings the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards he rode down for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she must act they met with the utmost friendliness there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree she watched him well it was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been absence with the conviction probably of her indifference had produced this very natural and very desirable effect he was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories and he was not without agitation it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative indifference he was not calm his spirits were evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him lively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself but what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a quarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed he had not stopped he would not stop for more than a word but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off she had no doubt as to his being less in love but neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days he was often hoping intending to come but was always prevented his aunt could not bear to have him leave her such was his own account at randall s if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come it was to be inferred that mrs churchill s removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder that she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself convinced of it at randalls though much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her but he could not be prevailed on by all his father s doubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong as ever it soon appeared that london was not the place for her she could not endure its noise her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering and by the ten days end her nephew s letter to randalls communicated a change of plan they were going to remove immediately to richmond mrs churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place a ready furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends for the house was taken for may and june she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he could even wish emma saw how mr weston understood these joyous prospects he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered she hoped it was not so two months must bring it to the proof mr weston s own happiness was indisputable he was quite delighted it was the very circumstance he could have wished for now it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood what were nine miles to a young man an hour s ride he would be always coming over the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never sixteen miles nay eighteen it must be full eighteen to manchester street was a serious obstacle were he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse better than nearer one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal the ball at the crown it had not been forgotten before but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day now however it was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from frank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty four hours at any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible mr weston s ball was to be a real thing a very few to morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness mr woodhouse was resigned the time of year lightened the evil to him may was better for every thing than february mrs bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them while dear emma were gone chapter ii no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball the day approached the day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching frank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls before dinner and every thing was safe no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma the room at the crown was to witness it but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd mr weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man s company she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just sufficiently before them frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch and though he did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening they all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize so unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself by particular desire to help mr weston s judgment and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity she liked his open manners but a little less of open heartedness would have made him a higher character general benevolence but not general friendship made a man what he ought to be she could fancy such a man the whole party walked about and looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do formed a sort of half circle round the fire to observe in their various modes till other subjects were started that though _ may _ a fire in the evening was still very pleasant emma found that it was not mr weston s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger they had stopped at mrs bates s door to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons frank was standing by her but not steadily there was a restlessness which shewed a mind not at ease he was looking about he was going to the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages impatient to begin or afraid of being always near her mrs elton was spoken of i think she must be here soon said he i have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much of her it cannot be long i think before she comes a carriage was heard he was on the move immediately but coming back said i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her i have never seen either mr or mrs elton i have no business to put myself forward mr and mrs elton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed but miss bates and miss fairfax said mr weston looking about we thought you were to bring them the mistake had been slight the carriage was sent for them now emma longed to know what frank s first opinion of mrs elton might be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of graciousness he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had passed in a few minutes the carriage returned somebody talked of rain i will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father miss bates must not be forgotten and away he went mr weston was following but mrs elton detained him to gratify him by her opinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of hearing a very fine young man indeed mr weston you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him you may believe me i never compliment i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approve so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them they were never tolerated at maple grove neither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better while she talked of his son mr weston s attention was chained but when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away mrs elton turned to mrs weston i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious i believe we drive faster than any body what a pleasure it is to send one s carriage for a friend i understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary you may be very sure i shall always take care of _ them _ miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into the room and mrs elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs weston s to receive them her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma but her words every body s words were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not hed her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire as the door opened she was heard so very obliging of you no rain at all nothing to signify i do not care for myself quite thick shoes and jane declares well as soon as she was within the door well this is brilliant indeed this is admirable excellently contrived upon my word nothing wanting could not have imagined it so well lighted up jane jane look did you ever see any thing oh mr weston you must really have had aladdin s lamp good mrs stokes would not know her own room again i saw her as i came in she was standing in the entrance oh mrs stokes said i but i had not time for more she was now met by mrs weston very well i thank you ma am i hope you are quite well very happy to hear it so afraid you might have a headache seeing you pass by so often and knowing how much trouble you must have delighted to hear it indeed ah dear mrs elton so obliged to you for the carriage excellent time jane and i quite ready did not keep the horses a moment most comfortable carriage oh and i am sure our thanks are due to you mrs weston on that score mrs elton had most kindly sent jane a note or we should have been but two such offers in one day never were such neighbours i said to my mother upon my word ma am thank you my mother is remarkably well gone to mr woodhouse s i made her take her shawl for the evenings are not warm her large new shawl mrs dixon s wedding present so kind of her to think of my mother bought at weymouth you know mr dixon s choice there were three others jane says which they hesitated about some time colonel campbell rather preferred an olive my dear jane are you sure you did not wet your feet it was but a drop or two but i am so afraid but mr frank churchill was so extremely and there was a mat to step upon i shall never forget his extreme politeness oh mr frank churchill i must tell you my mother s spectacles have never been in fault since the rivet never came out again my mother often talks of your good nature does not she jane do not we often talk of mr frank churchill ah here s miss woodhouse dear miss woodhouse how do you do very well i thank you quite well this is meeting quite in fairy land such a transformation must not compliment i know eyeing emma most complacently that would be rude but upon my word miss woodhouse you do look how do you like jane s hair you are a judge she did it all herself quite wonderful how she does her hair no hairdresser from london i think could ah dr hughes i declare and mrs hughes must go and speak to dr and mrs hughes for a moment how do you do how do you do very well i thank you this is delightful is not it where s dear mr richard oh there he is don t disturb him much better employed talking to the young ladies how do you do mr richard i saw you the other day as you rode through the town mrs otway i protest and good mr otway and miss otway and miss caroline such a host of friends and mr george and mr arthur how do you do how do you all do quite well i am much obliged to you never better don t i hear another carriage who can this be very likely the worthy coles upon my word this is charming to be standing about among such friends and such a noble fire i am quite roasted no coffee i thank you for me never take coffee a little tea if you please sir by and bye no hurry oh here it comes every thing so good frank churchill returned to his station by emma and as soon as miss bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little way behind her he was thoughtful whether he were overhearing too she could not determine after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken mrs elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself and it was how do you like my gown how do you like my trimming how has wright done my hair with many other relative questions all answered with patient politeness mrs elton then said nobody can think less of dress in general than i do but upon such an occasion as this when every body s eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westons who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour i would not wish to be inferior to others and i see very few pearls in the room except mine so frank churchill is a capital dancer i understand we shall see if our styles suit a fine young man certainly is frank churchill i like him very well at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear more and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while till another suspension brought mrs elton s tones again distinctly forward mr elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming oh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion i was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us jane repeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and displeasure that is easy but miss fairfax does not disapprove it i suppose how do you like mrs elton said emma in a whisper not at all you are ungrateful ungrateful what do you mean then changing from a frown to a smile no do not tell me i do not want to know what you mean where is my father when are we to begin dancing emma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour he walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both mr and mrs weston he had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before emma it had just occurred to mrs weston that mrs elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would expect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction emma heard the sad truth with fortitude and what are we to do for a proper partner for her said mr weston she will think frank ought to ask her frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect approbation of and it then appeared that mrs weston was wanting _ him _ to dance with mrs elton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon mr weston and mrs elton led the way mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed emma must submit to stand second to mrs elton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her it was almost enough to make her think of marrying mrs elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill she could not lose by the change mr weston might be his son s superior in spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her she was more disturbed by mr knightley s not dancing than by any thing else there he was among the standers by where he ought not to be he ought to be dancing not classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whist players who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up so young as he looked he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere than where he had placed himself his tall firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw every body s eyes and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him he moved a few steps nearer and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner with what natural grace he must have danced would he but take the trouble whenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile but in general he was looking grave she wished he could love a ballroom better and could like frank churchill better he seemed often observing her she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner they seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable the ball proceeded pleasantly the anxious cares the incessant attentions of mrs weston were not thrown away every body seemed happy and the praise of being a delightful ball which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this of very important very recordable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually are there was one however which emma thought something of the two last dances before supper were begun and harriet had no partner the only young lady sitting down and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder but emma s wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided she was sure he would not and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card room escape however was not his plan he came to the part of the room where the sitters by were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her emma saw it she was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw it all when she was half way up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr elton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs weston and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances the kind hearted gentle mrs weston had left her seat to join him and say do not you dance mr elton to which his prompt reply was most readily mrs weston if you will dance with me me oh no i would get you a better partner than myself i am no dancer if mrs gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great pleasure i am sure for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs gilbert mrs gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing miss smith miss smith oh i had not observed you are extremely obliging and if i were not an old married man but my dancing days are over mrs weston you will excuse me any thing else i should be most happy to do at your command but my dancing days are over mrs weston said no more and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat this was mr elton the amiable obliging gentle mr elton she looked round for a moment he had joined mr knightley at a little distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife she would not look again her heart was in a glow and she feared her face might be as hot in another moment a happier sight caught her mr knightley leading harriet to the set never had she been more surprized seldom more delighted than at that instant she was all pleasure and gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be thanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could catch his eye again his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it extremely good and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles mr elton had retreated into the card room looking emma trusted very foolish she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though growing very like her _ she _ spoke some of her feelings by observing audibly to her partner knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith very good natured i declare supper was announced the move began and miss bates might be heard from that moment without interruption till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon jane jane my dear jane where are you here is your tippet mrs weston begs you to put on your tippet she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done one door nailed up quantities of matting my dear jane indeed you must mr churchill oh you are too obliging how well you put it on so gratified excellent dancing indeed yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me i set off without saying a word just as i told you grandmama was quite well had a charming evening with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat and backgammon tea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners oh said i i shall not forestall jane i left her dancing with mr george otway she will love to tell you all about it herself to morrow her first partner was mr elton i do not know who will ask her next perhaps mr william cox my dear sir you are too obliging is there nobody you would not rather i am not helpless sir you are most kind upon my word jane on one arm and me on the other stop stop let us stand a little back mrs elton is going dear mrs elton how elegant she looks beautiful lace now we all follow in her train quite the queen of the evening well here we are at the passage two steps jane take care of the two steps oh no there is but one well i was persuaded there were two how very odd i was convinced there were two and there is but one i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style candles everywhere i was telling you of your grandmama jane there was a little disappointment the baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse who would be so very much concerned well this is brilliant i am all amazement could not have supposed any thing such elegance and profusion i have seen nothing like it since well where shall we sit where shall we sit anywhere so that jane is not in a draught where _ i _ sit is of no consequence oh do you recommend this side well i am sure mr churchill only it seems too good but just as you please what you direct in this house cannot be wrong dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama soup too bless me i should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i cannot help beginning emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr knightley till after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked he was warm in his reprobation of mr elton s conduct it had been unpardonable rudeness and mrs elton s looks also received the due share of censure they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he emma why is it that they are your enemies he looked with smiling penetration and on receiving no answer added _ she _ ought not to be angry with you i suspect whatever he may be to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet i did replied emma and they cannot forgive me he shook his head but there was a smile of indulgence with it and he only said i shall not scold you i leave you to your own reflections can you trust me with such flatterers does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong not your vain spirit but your serious spirit if one leads you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet it was through a series of strange blunders and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself harriet smith has some first rate qualities which mrs elton is totally without an unpretending single minded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs elton i found harriet more conversable than i expected emma was extremely gratified they were interrupted by the bustle of mr weston calling on every body to begin dancing again come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing come emma set your companions the example every body is lazy every body is asleep i am ready said emma whenever i am wanted whom are you going to dance with asked mr knightley she hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will ask me will you said he offering his hand indeed i will you have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper brother and sister no indeed chapter iii this little explanation with mr knightley gave emma considerable pleasure it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy she was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour was peculiarly gratifying the impertinence of the eltons which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked forward to another happy result the cure of harriet s infatuation from harriet s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom she had strong hopes it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr elton was not the superior creature she had believed him the fever was over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite harriet rational frank churchill not too much in love and mr knightley not wanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer must be before her she was not to see frank churchill this morning he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day she did not regret it having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa when the great iron sweep gate opened and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together frank churchill with harriet leaning on his arm actually harriet a moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened harriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her the iron gates and the front door were not twenty yards asunder they were all three soon in the hall and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away a young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered and surprizes be explained such events are very interesting but the suspense of them cannot last long a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole miss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at mrs goddard s who had been also at the ball had walked out together and taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public enough for safety had led them into alarm about half a mile beyond highbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them on a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies a child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on harriet to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury but poor harriet could not follow she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless and in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged to remain how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous and impertinent in look though not absolutely in word more and more frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more or to use her ill she was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving away but her terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang demanding more in this state frank churchill had found her she trembling and conditioning they loud and insolent by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond highbury and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates and to have forgotten to restore them he had been obliged to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes he was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion he had left them completely frightened and harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome it was his idea to bring her to hartfield he had thought of no other place this was the amount of the whole story of his communication and of harriet s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech he dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays left him not another minute to lose and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs goddard and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr knightley he set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself such an adventure as this a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain so emma thought at least could a linguist could a grammarian could even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other how much more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and foresight especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made it was a very extraordinary thing nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory no rencontre no alarm of the kind and now it had happened to the very person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her it certainly was very extraordinary and knowing as she did the favourable state of mind of each at this period it struck her the more he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for mr elton it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him while harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror her naïveté her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a sensibility amused and delighted and just at last after harriet s own account had been given he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms every thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled nor assisted she would not stir a step nor drop a hint no she had had enough of interference there could be no harm in a scheme a mere passive scheme it was no more than a wish beyond it she would on no account proceed emma s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible within half an hour it was known all over highbury it was the very event to engage those who talk most the young and the low and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news the last night s ball seemed lost in the gipsies poor mr woodhouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss smith were coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very indifferent which though not exactly true for she was perfectly well and harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not invent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took themselves off in a hurry the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephews in her imagination it maintained its ground and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital chapter iv a very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began miss woodhouse if you are at leisure i have something that i should like to tell you a sort of confession to make and then you know it will be over emma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak there was a seriousness in harriet s manner which prepared her quite as much as her words for something more than ordinary it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued to have no reserves with you on this subject as i am happily quite an altered creature in _ one _ _ respect _ it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it i do not want to say more than is necessary i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done and i dare say you understand me yes said emma i hope i do how i could so long a time be fancying myself cried harriet warmly it seems like madness i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now i do not care whether i meet him or not except that of the two i had rather not see him and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him but i do not envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her as i have done she is very charming i dare say and all that but i think her very ill tempered and disagreeable i shall never forget her look the other night however i assure you miss woodhouse i wish her no evil no let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another moment s pang and to convince you that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroy what i ought to have destroyed long ago what i ought never to have kept i know that very well blushing as she spoke however now i will destroy it all and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown cannot you guess what this parcel holds said she with a conscious look not the least in the world did he ever give you any thing no i cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have valued very much she held the parcel towards her and emma read the words _ most _ _ precious _ _ treasures _ on the top her curiosity was greatly excited harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge ware box which harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of court plaister now said harriet you _ must _ recollect no indeed i do not dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat just before mr and mrs john knightley came i think the very evening do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court plaister but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat my dearest harriet cried emma putting her hand before her face and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear remember it aye i remember it all now all except your saving this relic i knew nothing of that till this moment but the cutting the finger and my recommending court plaister and saying i had none about me oh my sins my sins and i had plenty all the while in my pocket one of my senseless tricks i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life well sitting down again go on what else and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake said emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement and secretly she added to herself lord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about i never was equal to this here resumed harriet turning to her box again here is something still more valuable i mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court plaister never did emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure it was the end of an old pencil the part without any lead this was really his said harriet do not you remember one morning no i dare say you do not but one morning i forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before _ that _ _ evening _ he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book it was about spruce beer mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment i do remember it cried emma i perfectly remember it talking about spruce beer oh yes mr knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too i perfectly remember it stop mr knightley was standing just here was not he i have an idea he was standing just here ah i do not know i cannot recollect it is very odd but i cannot recollect mr elton was sitting here i remember much about where i am now well go on oh that s all i have nothing more to shew you or to say except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see me do it my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things yes simpleton as i was but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married i knew it was but had not resolution enough to part with them but harriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister might be useful i shall be happier to burn it replied harriet it has a disagreeable look to me i must get rid of every thing there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton and when thought emma will there be a beginning of mr churchill she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had _ told _ no fortune might be proved to have made harriet s about a fortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation and quite undesignedly emma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the information she received more valuable she merely said in the course of some trivial chat well harriet whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and so and thought no more of it till after a minute s silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone i shall never marry emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and after a moment s debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied never marry this is a new resolution it is one that i shall never change however after another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed from i hope it is not in compliment to mr elton mr elton indeed cried harriet indignantly oh no and emma could just catch the words so superior to mr elton she then took a longer time for consideration should she proceed no farther should she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did or perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once all that she meant to say and know plain dealing was always best she had previously determined how far she would proceed on any application of the sort and it would be safer for both to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed she was decided and thus spoke harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you is not it so oh miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose indeed i am not so mad but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially i am not at all surprized at you harriet the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation the very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time when i saw him coming his noble look and my wretchedness before such a change in one moment such a change from perfect misery to perfect happiness it is very natural it is natural and it is honourable yes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully but that it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise i do not advise you to give way to it harriet i do not by any means engage for its being returned consider what you are about perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you be observant of him let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations i give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on the subject i am determined against all interference henceforward i know nothing of the matter let no name ever pass our lips we were very wrong before we will be cautious now he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity but take care of yourself i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to _ him _ is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation chapter v in this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened upon hartfield to highbury in general it brought no material change the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings and of the use to be made of their barouche landau and jane fairfax was still at her grandmother s and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able to defeat mrs elton s activity in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will mr knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike him more he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma that emma was his object appeared indisputable every thing declared it his own attentions his father s hints his mother in law s guarded silence it was all in unison words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story but while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him over to harriet mr knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax he could not understand it but there were symptoms of intelligence between them he thought so at least symptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emma s errors of imagination _ she _ was not present when the suspicion first arose he was dining with the randalls family and jane at the eltons and he had seen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which from the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place when he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight myself creating what i saw brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking of private understanding even between frank churchill and jane he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at hartfield emma and harriet were going to walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the weather threatened rain mr and mrs weston and their son miss bates and her niece who had accidentally met they all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him the randalls party agreed to it immediately and after a pretty long speech from miss bates which few persons listened to she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse s most obliging invitation as they were turning into the grounds mr perry passed by on horseback the gentlemen spoke of his horse by the bye said frank churchill to mrs weston presently what became of mr perry s plan of setting up his carriage mrs weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he ever had any such plan nay i had it from you you wrote me word of it three months ago me impossible indeed you did i remember it perfectly you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon mrs perry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it it was owing to _ her _ persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm you must remember it now upon my word i never heard of it till this moment never really never bless me how could it be then i must have dreamt it but i was completely persuaded miss smith you walk as if you were tired you will not be sorry to find yourself at home what is this what is this cried mr weston about perry and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you no sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it from nobody very odd i really was persuaded of mrs weston s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry it is odd though observed his father that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer i think emma was out of hearing she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of mr weston s hint why to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have i do not mean to say that he did not dream it i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed jane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed i do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were i will answer for it _ she _ never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed they were entering the hall mr knightley s eyes had preceded miss bates s in a glance at jane from frank churchill s face where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind and too busy with her shawl mr weston had walked in the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass mr knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye he seemed watching her intently in vain however if it were so jane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither there was no time for farther remark or explanation the dream must be borne with and mr knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use instead of the small sized pembroke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters it used to stand here where is it this is a sort of dull looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves they were rapidly forming words for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort which mr weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax she gave a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it frank was next to emma jane opposite to them and mr knightley so placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much as he could with as little apparent observation the word was discovered and with a faint smile pushed away if meant to be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across for it was not mixed and harriet eager after every fresh word and finding out none directly took it up and fell to work she was sitting by mr knightley and turned to him for help the word was _ blunder _ and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a blush on jane s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible mr knightley connected it with the dream but how it could all be was beyond his comprehension how the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep he feared there must be some decided involvement disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick it was a child s play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchill s part with great indignation did he continue to observe him with great alarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions he saw a short word prepared for emma and given to her with a look sly and demure he saw that emma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure for she said nonsense for shame he heard frank churchill next say with a glance towards jane i will give it to her shall i and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth no no you must not you shall not indeed it was done however this gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it mr knightley s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was not long before he saw it to be _ dixon _ jane fairfax s perception seemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters so arranged she was evidently displeased looked up and seeing herself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying only i did not know that proper names were allowed pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered her face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned towards her aunt aye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not spoken a word i was just going to say the same thing it is time for us to be going indeed the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us my dear sir you are too obliging we really must wish you good night jane s alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived she was immediately up and wanting to quit the table but so many were also moving that she could not get away and mr knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined she was afterwards looking for her shawl frank churchill was looking also it was growing dusk and the room was in confusion and how they parted mr knightley could not tell he remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full of what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist his observations he must yes he certainly must as a friend an anxious friend give emma some hint ask her some question he could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to preserve her it was his duty pray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other emma was extremely confused she could not endure to give him the true explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them oh she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves the joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you and mr churchill he had hoped she would speak again but she did not she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak he sat a little while in doubt a variety of evils crossed his mind interference fruitless interference emma s confusion and the acknowledged intimacy seemed to declare her affection engaged yet he would speak he owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter any thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause my dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly why do you make a doubt of it have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him never never she cried with a most open eagerness never for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me and how could it possibly come into your head i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them certain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public oh you amuse me excessively i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander but it will not do very sorry to check you in your first essay but indeed it will not do there is no admiration between them i do assure you and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstances feelings rather of a totally different nature it is impossible exactly to explain there is a good deal of nonsense in it but the part which is capable of being communicated which is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be that is i _ presume _ it to be so on her side and i can _ answer _ for its being so on his i will answer for the gentleman s indifference she spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction which silenced mr knightley she was in gay spirits and would have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers he found he could not be useful and his feelings were too much irritated for talking that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever by the fire which mr woodhouse s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon afterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey chapter vi after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr and mrs suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present in the daily interchange of news they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings coming had been united such as the last accounts of mrs churchill whose health seemed every day to supply a different report and the situation of mrs weston whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it mrs elton was very much disappointed it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade her introductions and recommendations must all wait and every projected party be still only talked of so she thought at first but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come they could go there again with them in the autumn it was settled that they should go to box hill that there was to be such a party had been long generally known it had even given the idea of another emma had never been to box hill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and mr weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from mr weston that he had been proposing to mrs elton as her brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite and go together and that as mrs elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection now as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton of which mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth bringing forward again it could not be done without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs elton s party every feeling was offended and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr weston s temper i am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably but i thought you would such schemes as these are nothing without numbers one cannot have too large a party a large party secures its own amusement and she is a good natured woman after all one could not leave her out emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private it was now the middle of june and the weather fine and mrs elton was growing impatient to name the day and settle with mr weston as to pigeon pies and cold lamb when a lame carriage horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty it might be weeks it might be only a few days before the horse were useable but no preparations could be ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation mrs elton s resources were inadequate to such an attack is not this most vexatious knightley she cried and such weather for exploring these delays and disappointments are quite odious what are we to do the year will wear away at this rate and nothing done before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston you had better explore to donwell replied mr knightley that may be done without horses come and eat my strawberries they are ripening fast if mr knightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so for his proposal was caught at with delight and the oh i should like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner donwell was famous for its strawberry beds which seemed a plea for the invitation but no plea was necessary cabbage beds would have been enough to tempt the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere she promised him again and again to come much oftener than he doubted and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it you may depend upon me said she i certainly will come name your day and i will come you will allow me to bring jane fairfax i cannot name a day said he till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you oh leave all that to me only give me a carte blanche i am lady patroness you know it is my party i will bring friends with me i hope you will bring elton said he but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations oh now you are looking very sly but consider you need not be afraid of delegating power to _ me _ i am no young lady on her preferment married women you know may be safely authorised it is my party leave it all to me i will invite your guests no he calmly replied there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell and that one is mrs weston i suppose interrupted mrs elton rather mortified no mrs knightley and till she is in being i will manage such matters myself ah you are an odd creature she cried satisfied to have no one preferred to herself you are a humourist and may say what you like quite a humourist well i shall bring jane with me jane and her aunt the rest i leave to you i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family don t scruple i know you are attached to them you certainly will meet them if i can prevail and i shall call on miss bates in my way home that s quite unnecessary i see jane every day but as you like it is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing i shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm here probably this basket with pink ribbon nothing can be more simple you see and jane will have such another there is to be no form or parade a sort of gipsy party we are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees and whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doors a table spread in the shade you know every thing as natural and simple as possible is not that your idea not quite my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining room the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is best observed by meals within doors when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house well as you please only don t have a great set out and by the bye can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion pray be sincere knightley if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges or to inspect anything i have not the least wish for it i thank you well but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever i will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and would spurn any body s assistance i wish we had a donkey the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys jane miss bates and me and my caro sposo walking by i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home and very long walks you know in summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt you will not find either between donwell and highbury donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry come on a donkey however if you prefer it you can borrow mrs cole s i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible that i am sure you would indeed i do you justice my good friend under that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the warmest heart as i tell mr e you are a thorough humourist yes believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme you have hit upon the very thing to please me mr knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade he wished to persuade mr woodhouse as well as emma to join the party and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill mr woodhouse must not under the specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two spent at donwell be tempted away to his misery he was invited on good faith no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity he did consent he had not been at donwell for two years some very fine morning he and emma and harriet could go very well and he could sit still with mrs weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens he did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of the day he should like to see the old house again exceedingly and should be very happy to meet mr and mrs elton and any other of his neighbours he could not see any objection at all to his and emma s and harriet s going there some very fine morning he thought it very well done of mr knightley to invite them very kind and sensible much cleverer than dining out he was not fond of dining out mr knightley was fortunate in every body s most ready concurrence the invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if like mrs elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it and mr weston unasked promised to get frank over to join them if possible a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with mr knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him and mr weston engaged to lose no time in writing and spare no arguments to induce him to come in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration and at last donwell was settled for one day and box hill for the next the weather appearing exactly right under a bright mid day sun at almost midsummer mr woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of this al fresco party and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise every body to come and sit down and not to heat themselves mrs weston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired and sit all the time with him remained when all the others were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she was satisfied of her father s comfort she was glad to leave him and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream of which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sight and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up the house was larger than hartfield and totally unlike it covering a good deal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable and one or two handsome rooms it was just what it ought to be and it looked what it was and emma felt an increasing respect for it as the residence of a family of such true gentility untainted in blood and understanding some faults of temper john knightley had but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably she had given them neither men nor names nor places that could raise a blush these were pleasant feelings and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did and collect round the strawberry beds the whole party were assembled excepting frank churchill who was expected every moment from richmond and mrs elton in all her apparatus of happiness her large bonnet and her basket was very ready to lead the way in gathering accepting or talking strawberries and only strawberries could now be thought or spoken of the best fruit in england every body s favourite always wholesome these the finest beds and finest sorts delightful to gather for one s self the only way of really enjoying them morning decidedly the best time never tired every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce chili preferred white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in london abundance about bristol maple grove cultivation beds when to be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade such for half an hour was the conversation interrupted only once by mrs weston who came out in her solicitude after her son in law to inquire if he were come and she was a little uneasy she had some fears of his horse seats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs elton and jane fairfax were talking of a situation a most desirable situation was in question mrs elton had received notice of it that morning and was in raptures it was not with mrs suckling it was not with mrs bragge but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them it was with a cousin of mrs bragge an acquaintance of mrs suckling a lady known at maple grove delightful charming superior first circles spheres lines ranks every thing and mrs elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately on her side all was warmth energy and triumph and she positively refused to take her friend s negative though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before still mrs elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow s post how jane could bear it at all was astonishing to emma she did look vexed she did speak pointedly and at last with a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removal should not they walk would not mr knightley shew them the gardens all the gardens she wished to see the whole extent the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear it was hot and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed the h of the pleasure grounds it led to nothing nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had been there disputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty the considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curve around it it was a sweet view sweet to the eye and the mind english verdure english culture english comfort seen under a sun bright without being oppressive in this walk emma and mr weston found all the others assembled and towards this view she immediately perceived mr knightley and harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way mr knightley and harriet it was an odd tête à tête but she was glad to see it there had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony now they seemed in pleasant conversation there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom and light column of smoke ascending she joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc and emma received a smile which seemed to say these are my own concerns i have a right to talk on such subjects without being suspected of introducing robert martin she did not suspect him it was too old a story robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet they took a few turns together along the walk the shade was most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day the next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat and they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come mrs weston looked and looked in vain his father would not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare he had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty his aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting over to them mrs churchill s state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence and mrs weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of mrs churchill that he was prevented coming emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion the cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fish ponds perhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting on the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot and growing cool again mr woodhouse who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens where no damps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more and his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need mr knightley had done all in his power for mr woodhouse s entertainment books of engravings drawers of medals cameos corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets had been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning and the kindness had perfectly answered mr woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused mrs weston had been shewing them all to him and now he would shew them all to emma fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw for he was slow constant and methodical before this second looking over was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments free observation of the entrance and ground plot of the house and was hardly there when jane fairfax appeared coming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there was a start at first but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of will you be so kind said she when i am missed as to say that i am gone home i am going this moment my aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absent but i am sure we shall be wanted and i am determined to go directly i have said nothing about it to any body it would only be giving trouble and distress some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk till they all come in i shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am gone certainly if you wish it but you are not going to walk to highbury alone yes what should hurt me i walk fast i shall be at home in twenty minutes but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone let my father s servant go with you let me order the carriage it can be round in five minutes thank you thank you but on no account i would rather walk and for _ me _ to be afraid of walking alone i who may so soon have to guard others she spoke with great agitation and emma very feelingly replied that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now i must order the carriage the heat even would be danger you are fatigued already i am she answered i am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh me miss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits mine i confess are exhausted the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary emma had not another word to oppose she saw it all and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend her parting look was grateful and her parting words oh miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone seemed to burst from an overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who loved her best such a home indeed such an aunt said emma as she turned back into the hall again i do pity you and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the more i shall like you jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only accomplished some views of st mark s place venice when frank churchill entered the room emma had not been thinking of him she had forgotten to think of him but she was very glad to see him mrs weston would be at ease the black mare was blameless _ they _ were right who had named mrs churchill as the cause he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her a nervous seizure which had lasted some hours and he had quite given up every thought of coming till very late and had he known how hot a ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be he believed he should not have come at all the heat was excessive he had never suffered any thing like it almost wished he had staid at home nothing killed him like heat he could bear any degree of cold etc but heat was intolerable and he sat down at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr woodhouse s fire looking very deplorable you will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again i could very ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up i met _ one _ as i came madness in such weather absolute madness emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchill s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour some people were always cross when they were hot such might be his constitution and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance of every thing in the dining room and she humanely pointed out the door no he should not eat he was not hungry it would only make him hotter in two minutes however he relented in his own favour and muttering something about spruce beer walked off emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret i am glad i have done being in love with him i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning harriet s sweet easy temper will not mind it he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came back all the better grown quite cool and with good manners like himself able to draw a chair close to them take an interest in their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he should be so late he was not in his best spirits but seemed trying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense very agreeably they were looking over views in swisserland as soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad said he i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places you will have my sketches some time or other to look at or my tour to read or my poem i shall do something to expose myself that may be but not by sketches in swisserland you will never go to swisserland your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england they may be induced to go too a warm climate may be prescribed for her i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad i assure you i have i feel a strong persuasion this morning that i shall soon be abroad i ought to travel i am tired of doing nothing i want a change i am serious miss woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy i am sick of england and would leave it to morrow if i could you are sick of prosperity and indulgence cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay _ i _ sick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged i am thwarted in every thing material i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us no i shall not stir i shall sit by you you are my best cure we are going to box hill to morrow you will join us it is not swisserland but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change you will stay and go with us no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening but you may come again in the cool of to morrow morning no it will not be worth while if i come i shall be cross then pray stay at richmond but if i do i shall be crosser still i can never bear to think of you all there without me these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself chuse your own degree of crossness i shall press you no more the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill others took it very composedly but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfax s disappearance being explained that it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and with a short final arrangement for the next day s scheme they parted frank churchill s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last words to emma were well if _ you _ wish me to stay and join the party i will she smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening chapter vii they had a very fine day for box hill and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality were in favour of a pleasant party mr weston directed the whole officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every body was in good time emma and harriet went together miss bates and her niece with the eltons the gentlemen on horseback mrs weston remained with mr woodhouse nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency there was a languor a want of spirits a want of union which could not be got over they separated too much into parties the eltons walked together mr knightley took charge of miss bates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill and mr weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better it seemed at first an accidental division but it never materially varied mr and mrs elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation between the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any cold collation or any cheerful mr weston to remove at first it was downright dulness to emma she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid he said nothing worth hearing looked without seeing admired without intelligence listened without knowing what she said while he was so dull it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable when they all sat down it was better to her taste a great deal better for frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared for and emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively they were laying themselves open to that very phrase and to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady to ireland by another not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected she laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning back her heart she still intended him for her friend how much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come to day if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party i had quite determined to go away again yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries i was a kinder friend than you deserved but you were humble you begged hard to be commanded to come don t say i was cross i was fatigued the heat overcame me it is hotter to day not to my feelings i am perfectly comfortable to day you are comfortable because you are under command your command yes perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant self command you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to day you are got back again and as i cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine it comes to the same thing i can have no self command without a motive you order me whether you speak or not and you can be always with me you are always with me dating from three o clock yesterday my perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before three o clock yesterday that is your date i thought i had seen you first in february your gallantry is really unanswerable but lowering her voice nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people i say nothing of which i am ashamed replied he with lively impudence i saw you first in february let every body on the hill hear me if they can let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other i saw you first in february and then whispering our companions are excessively stupid what shall we do to rouse them any nonsense will serve they _ shall _ talk ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of some laughed and answered good humouredly miss bates said a great deal mrs elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse s presiding mr knightley s answer was the most distinct is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of oh no no cried emma laughing as carelessly as she could upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps glancing at mr weston and harriet whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing it is a sort of thing cried mrs elton emphatically which _ i _ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into though perhaps as the _ chaperon _ of the party _ i _ never was in any circle exploring parties young ladies married women her mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured in reply very true my love very true exactly so indeed quite unheard of but some ladies say any thing better pass it off as a joke every body knows what is due to _ you _ it will not do whispered frank to emma they are most of them affronted i will attack them with more address ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeated or two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all oh very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy three things very dull indeed that will just do for me you know i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth shan t i looking round with the most good humoured dependence on every body s assent do not you all think i shall emma could not resist ah ma am but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once miss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not immediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could not anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her ah well to be sure yes i see what she means turning to mr knightley and i will try to hold my tongue i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend i like your plan cried mr weston agreed agreed i will do my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon low i am afraid sir very low answered his son but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way no no said emma it will not reckon low a conundrum of mr weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour come sir pray let me hear it i doubt its being very clever myself said mr weston it is too much a matter of fact but here it is what two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection what two letters express perfection i am sure i do not know ah you will never guess you to emma i am certain will never guess i will tell you m and a em ma do you understand understanding and gratification came together it might be a very indifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it and so did frank and harriet it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid about it and mr knightley gravely said this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else _ perfection _ should not have come quite so soon oh for myself i protest i must be excused said mrs elton _ i _ really cannot attempt i am not at all fond of the sort of thing i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all pleased with i knew who it came from an abominable puppy you know who i mean nodding to her husband these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer miss woodhouse must excuse me i am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service i do not pretend to be a wit i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue pass us if you please mr churchill pass mr e knightley jane and myself we have nothing clever to say not one of us yes yes pray pass _ me _ added her husband with a sort of sneering consciousness _ i _ have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta with all my heart i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot come jane take my other arm jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off happy couple said frank churchill as soon as they were out of hearing how well they suit one another very lucky marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place they only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath peculiarly lucky for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that bath or any public place can give it is all nothing there can be no knowledge it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment short of that it is all guess and luck and will generally be ill luck how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now such things do occur undoubtedly she was stopped by a cough frank churchill turned towards her to listen you were speaking said he gravely she recovered her voice i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever he made no answer merely looked and bowed in submission and soon afterwards said in a lively tone well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me will you turning to emma will you chuse a wife for me i am sure i should like any body fixed on by you you provide for the family you know with a smile at his father find some body for me i am in no hurry adopt her educate her and make her like myself by all means if you can very well i undertake the commission you shall have a charming wife she must be very lively and have hazle eyes i care for nothing else i shall go abroad for a couple of years and when i return i shall come to you for my wife remember emma was in no danger of forgetting it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling would not harriet be the very creature described hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment who could say referring the education to her seemed to imply it now ma am said jane to her aunt shall we join mrs elton if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well we shall soon overtake her there she is no that s somebody else that s one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her well i declare they walked off followed in half a minute by mr knightley mr weston his son emma and harriet only remained and the young man s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart and the solicitude of mrs elton to have _ her _ carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure such another scheme composed of so many ill assorted people she hoped never to be betrayed into again while waiting for the carriage she found mr knightley by her side he looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation emma i had not thought it possible emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off nay how could i help saying what i did nobody could have helped it it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome oh cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her they are blended said he i acknowledge and were she prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner were she your equal in situation but emma consider how far this is from being the case she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more her situation should secure your compassion it was badly done indeed you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly _ some _ would be entirely guided by _ your _ treatment of her this is not pleasant to you emma and it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i will i will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless they were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern she had not been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcome then reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference but it was just too late he had turned away and the horses were in motion she continued to look back but in vain and soon with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and every thing left far behind she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed almost beyond what she could conceal never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life she was most forcibly struck the truth of this representation there was no denying she felt it at her heart how could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness time did not compose her as she reflected more she seemed but to feel it more she never had been so depressed happily it was not necessary to speak there was only harriet who seemed not in spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were chapter viii the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma s thoughts all the evening how it might be considered by the rest of the party she could not tell they in their different homes and their different ways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than any she had ever passed a whole evening of back gammon with her father was felicity to it _ there _ indeed lay real pleasure for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty four to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach as a daughter she hoped she was not without a heart she hoped no one could have said to her how could you be so unfeeling to your father i must i will tell you truths while i can miss bates should never again no never if attention in future could do away the past she might hope to be forgiven she had been often remiss her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious but it should be so no more in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should be the beginning on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her it was not unlikely she thought that she might see mr knightley in her way or perhaps he might come in while she were paying her visit she had no objection she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she saw him not the ladies were all at home she had never rejoiced at the sound before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule there was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking she heard miss bates s voice something was to be done in a hurry the maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room jane she had a distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door had shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dear i shall _ say _ you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are ill enough poor old mrs bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on i am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know they _ tell _ me she is well i dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhouse i hope you find a chair i wish hetty had not gone i am very little able have you a chair ma am do you sit where you like i am sure she will be here presently emma seriously hoped she would she had a moment s fear of miss bates keeping away from her but miss bates soon came very happy and obliged but emma s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before less ease of look and manner a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead the way to a return of old feelings the touch seemed immediate ah miss woodhouse how kind you are i suppose you have heard and are come to give us joy this does not seem much like joy indeed in me twinkling away a tear or two but it will be very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long and she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morning such long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell and mrs dixon my dear said i you will blind yourself for tears were in her eyes perpetually one cannot wonder one cannot wonder it is a great change and though she is amazingly fortunate such a situation i suppose as no young woman before ever met with on first going out do not think us ungrateful miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortune again dispersing her tears but poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache she has when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve she is as low as possible to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation you will excuse her not coming to you she is not able she is gone into her own room i want her to lie down upon the bed my dear said i i shall say you are laid down upon the bed but however she is not she is walking about the room but now that she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will excuse her you were kept waiting at the door i was quite ashamed but somehow there was a little bustle for it so happened that we had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did not know any body was coming it is only mrs cole said i depend upon it nobody else would come so early well said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now but then patty came in and said it was you oh said i it is miss woodhouse i am sure you will like to see her i can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away and that was what made us keep you waiting and extremely sorry and ashamed we were if you must go my dear said i you must and i will say you are laid down upon the bed emma was most sincerely interested her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs cole or any other steady friend when she might not bear to see herself she spoke as she felt with earnest regret and solicitude sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on might be as much for miss fairfax s advantage and comfort as possible it must be a severe trial to them all she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell s return so very kind replied miss bates but you are always kind there was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of where may i ask is miss fairfax going to a mrs smallridge charming woman most superior to have the charge of her three little girls delightful children impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps mrs suckling s own family and mrs bragge s but mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood lives only four miles from maple grove jane will be only four miles from maple grove mrs elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes yes our good mrs elton the most indefatigable true friend she would not take a denial she would not let jane say no for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell s return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present and so she told mrs elton over and over again and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind but that good mrs elton whose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take jane s answer but she positively declared she would _ not _ write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her she would wait and sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go quite a surprize to me i had not the least idea jane took mrs elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridge s situation she had come to the resolution of accepting it i did not know a word of it till it was all settled you spent the evening with mrs elton yes all of us mrs elton would have us come it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley you _ must _ _ all _ spend your evening with us said she i positively must have you _ all _ come mr knightley was there too was he no not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i thought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let him off he did not but my mother and jane and i were all there and a very agreeable evening we had such kind friends you know miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning s party even pleasure you know is fatiguing and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it however _ i _ shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole day i dare say she had whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible i mean as to the character and manners of the family thank you dear miss woodhouse yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it except the sucklings and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs elton s acquaintance mrs smallridge a most delightful woman a style of living almost equal to maple grove and as to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere jane will be treated with such regard and kindness it will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasure and her salary i really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane ah madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned you are so noble in your ideas and when is miss fairfax to leave you very soon very soon indeed that s the worst of it within a fortnight mrs smallridge is in a great hurry my poor mother does not know how to bear it so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and say come ma am do not let us think about it any more her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdy s son wanted to speak with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all and poor john s son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr frank churchill s going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence what mr elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the accumulation of the ostler s own knowledge and the knowledge of the servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill which messenger however had been no more than was expected and that mr churchill had sent his nephew a few lines containing upon the whole a tolerable account of mrs churchill and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early but that mr frank churchill having resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and his horse seeming to have got a cold tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy going a good pace and driving very steady there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it caught emma s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind the contrast between mrs churchill s importance in the world and jane fairfax s struck her one was every thing the other nothing and she sat musing on the difference of woman s destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by miss bates s saying aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become of that very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now you must go said she you and i must part you will have no business here let it stay however said she give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back i shall talk about it to him he will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficulties and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave chapter ix emma s pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her mr knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting with her father mr knightley immediately got up and in a manner decidedly graver than usual said i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly i am going to london to spend a few days with john and isabella have you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time emma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself time however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends again while he stood as if meaning to go but not going her father began his inquiries well my dear and did you get there safely and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before she is always so attentive to them emma s colour was heightened by this unjust praise and with a smile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr knightley it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour as if his eyes received the truth from hers and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured he looked at her with a glow of regard she was warmly gratified and in another moment still more so by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part he took her hand whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say she might perhaps have rather offered it but he took her hand pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips when from some fancy or other he suddenly let it go why he should feel such a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not perceive he would have judged better she thought if he had not stopped the intention however was indubitable and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more it was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction it spoke such perfect amity he left them immediately afterwards gone in a moment he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier it would have been a great pleasure to talk over jane fairfax s situation with mr knightley neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed but it might have happened at a better time and to have had longer notice of it would have been pleasanter they parted thorough friends however she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unhed gallantry it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion he had been sitting with them half an hour she found it was a pity that she had not come back earlier in the hope of diverting her father s thoughts from the disagreeableness of mr knightley s going to london and going so suddenly and going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad emma communicated her news of jane fairfax and her dependence on the effect was justified it supplied a very useful check interested without disturbing him he had long made up his mind to jane fairfax s going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully but mr knightley s going to london had been an unexpected blow i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled mrs elton is very good natured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of it ought to be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylor s always was with me you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs churchill though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account she had not lived above six and thirty hours after his return a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state had carried her off after a short struggle the great mrs churchill was no more it was felt as such things must be felt every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried goldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do but to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill fame mrs churchill after being disliked at least twenty five years was now spoken of with compassionate allowances in one point she was fully justified she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints poor mrs churchill no doubt she had been suffering a great deal more than any body had ever supposed and continual pain would try the temper it was a sad event a great shock with all her faults what would mr churchill do without her mr churchill s loss would be dreadful indeed mr churchill would never get over it even mr weston shook his head and looked solemn and said ah poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his mourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense true and steady how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both it was also a very early speculation with emma the character of mrs churchill the grief of her husband her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event how benefited how freed she saw in a moment all the possible good now an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter mr churchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great self command what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing emma was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance they spoke therefore of mrs churchill s death with mutual forbearance short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans mr churchill was better than could be expected and their first removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor to whom mr churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years at present there was nothing to be done for harriet good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emma s side it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax whose prospects were closing while harriet s opened and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished to shew her kindness and with emma it was grown into a first wish she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness and the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew a value for her society and testify respect and consideration she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield a note was written to urge it the invitation was refused and by a verbal message miss fairfax was not well enough to write and when mr perry called at hartfield the same morning it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited though against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering under severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs smallridge s at the time proposed her health seemed for the moment completely deranged appetite quite gone and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension of the family mr perry was uneasy about her he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would not own it her spirits seemed overcome her present home he could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous disorder confined always to one room he could have wished it otherwise and her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description her care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact only too great he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them emma listened with the warmest concern grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful to take her be it only an hour or two from her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two might do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name mentioning that she had mr perry s decided opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient the answer was only in this short note miss fairfax s compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any exercise emma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it was impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted in spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove to mrs bates s in the hope that jane would be induced to join her but it would not do miss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service and every thing that message could do was tried but all in vain miss bates was obliged to return without success jane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse emma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body any body at all mrs elton indeed could not be denied and mrs cole had made such a point and mrs perry had said so much but except them jane would really see nobody emma did not want to be classed with the mrs eltons the mrs perrys and the mrs coles who would force themselves anywhere neither could she feel any right of preference herself she submitted therefore and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece s appetite and diet which she longed to be able to assist on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy and very communicative jane would hardly eat any thing mr perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an examination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note in half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks from miss bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back it was a thing she could not take and moreover she insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon of the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage she could have no doubt putting every thing together that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _ her _ she was sorry very sorry her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself that could mr knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart he would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove chapter x one morning about ten days after mrs churchill s decease emma was called downstairs to mr weston who could not stay five minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her he met her at the parlour door and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father can you come to randalls at any time this morning do if it be possible mrs weston wants to see you she must see you is she unwell no no not at all only a little agitated she would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you _ alone _ and that you know nodding towards her father humph can you come certainly this moment if you please it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way but what can be the matter is she really not ill depend upon me but ask no more questions you will know it all in time the most unaccountable business but hush hush to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma something really important seemed announced by his looks but as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father that she would take her walk now she and mr weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls now said emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates now mr weston do let me know what has happened no no he gravely replied don t ask me i promised my wife to leave it all to her she will break it to you better than i can do not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon break it to me cried emma standing still with terror good god mr weston tell me at once something has happened in brunswick square i know it has tell me i charge you tell me this moment what it is no indeed you are mistaken mr weston do not trifle with me consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square which of them is it i charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment upon my word emma your word why not your honour why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them good heavens what can be to be _ broke _ to me that does not relate to one of that family upon my honour said he very seriously it does not it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley emma s courage returned and she walked on i was wrong he continued in talking of its being _ broke _ to you i should not have used the expression in fact it does not concern you it concerns only myself that is we hope humph in short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it i don t say that it is not a disagreeable business but things might be much worse if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern something just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family something which the late event at richmond had brought forward her fancy was very active half a dozen natural children perhaps and poor frank cut off this though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her it inspired little more than an animating curiosity who is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded speaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with any other view i do not know one of the otways not frank it is not frank i assure you you will not see him he is half way to windsor by this time has your son been with you then oh yes did not you know well well never mind for a moment he was silent and then added in a tone much more guarded and demure yes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did they hurried on and were speedily at randalls well my dear said he as they entered the room i have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better i shall leave you together there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me and emma distinctly heard him add in a lower tone before he quitted the room i have been as good as my word she has not the least idea mrs weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation that emma s uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone she eagerly said what is it my dear friend something of a very unpleasant nature i find has occurred do let me know directly what it is i have been walking all this way in complete suspense we both abhor suspense do not let mine continue longer it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be have you indeed no idea said mrs weston in a trembling voice cannot you my dear emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear so far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess you are right it does relate to him and i will tell you directly resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up he has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand it is impossible to express our surprize he came to speak to his father on a subject to announce an attachment she stopped to breathe emma thought first of herself and then of harriet more than an attachment indeed resumed mrs weston an engagement a positive engagement what will you say emma what will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged nay that they have been long engaged emma even jumped with surprize and horror struck exclaimed jane fairfax good god you are not serious you do not mean it you may well be amazed returned mrs weston still averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover you may well be amazed but it is even so there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october formed at weymouth and kept a secret from every body not a creature knowing it but themselves neither the campbells nor her family nor his it is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself i can hardly believe it i thought i knew him emma scarcely heard what was said her mind was divided between two ideas her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax and poor harriet and for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation repeated confirmation well said she at last trying to recover herself this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at all comprehend it what engaged to her all the winter before either of them came to highbury engaged since october secretly engaged it has hurt me emma very much it has hurt his father equally _ some _ _ part _ of his conduct we cannot excuse emma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend _ not _ to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of mrs weston looked up afraid to believe but emma s countenance was as steady as her words that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to him nay was attached and how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder fortunately however it did cease i have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him you may believe me mrs weston this is the simple truth mrs weston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could find utterance assured her that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do mr weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she on this point we have been wretched it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other and we were persuaded that it was so imagine what we have been feeling on your account i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself but this does not acquit _ him _ mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so _ very _ disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did while he really belonged to another how could he tell what mischief he might be doing how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him very wrong very wrong indeed from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine and how could _ she _ bear such behaviour composure with a witness to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent it that is a degree of placidity which i can neither comprehend nor respect there were misunderstandings between them emma he said so expressly he had not time to enter into much explanation he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct impropriety oh mrs weston it is too calm a censure much much beyond impropriety it has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion so unlike what a man should be none of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life nay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and good god cried emma not attending to her mrs smallridge too jane actually on the point of going as governess what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer her to engage herself to suffer her even to think of such a measure he knew nothing about it emma on this article i can fully acquit him it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to him or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction till yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long emma began to listen better i am to hear from him soon continued mrs weston he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now let us wait therefore for this letter it may bring many extenuations it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood don t let us be severe don t let us be in a hurry to condemn him let us have patience i must love him and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment _ his _ sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done him much harm well and how did mr churchill take it most favourably for his nephew gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty conceive what the events of a week have done in that family while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a hope a chance a possibility but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required what a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave he gave his consent with very little persuasion ah thought emma he would have done as much for harriet this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this morning he stopped at highbury at the bates s i fancy some time and then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour he was very much agitated very much indeed to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before in addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy the campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush none not one he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves well said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and i wish them very happy but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit espionage and treachery to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us all here have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear they must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable i am quite easy on that head replied mrs weston i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard you are in luck your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady true but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe at this moment mr weston appeared at a little distance from the window evidently on the watch his wife gave him a look which invited him in and while he was coming round added now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error much indeed cried emma feelingly if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfax s of such one may almost say that the world is not their s nor the world s law she met mr weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance exclaiming a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing but you really frightened me i thought you had lost half your property at least and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation i congratulate you mr weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter a glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate his air and voice recovered their usual briskness he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence or smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all over together and he had talked it all over again with emma in their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly reconciled and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done chapter xi harriet poor harriet those were the words in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted the real misery of the business to her frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself very ill in many ways but it was not so much _ his _ behaviour as her _ own _ which made her so angry with him it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet s account that gave the deepest hue to his offence poor harriet to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery mr knightley had spoken prophetically when he once said emma you have been no friend to harriet smith she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice it was true that she had not to charge herself in this instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet s imagination for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments her influence would have been enough and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them she felt that she had been risking her friend s happiness on most insufficient grounds common sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her but with common sense she added i am afraid i have had little to do she was extremely angry with herself if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful as for jane fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account harriet would be anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about jane whose troubles and whose ill health having of course the same origin must be equally under cure her days of insignificance and evil were over she would soon be well and happy and prosperous emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted this discovery laid many smaller matters open no doubt it had been from jealousy in jane s eyes she had been a rival and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison she understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first considering the very superior claims of the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriet s mind producing reserve and self command it would she must communicate the painful truth however and as soon as possible an injunction of secresy had been among mr weston s parting words for the present the whole affair was to be completely a secret mr churchill had made a point of it as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum emma had promised but still harriet must be excepted it was her superior duty in spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet which mrs weston had just gone through by herself the intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her she was now to be anxiously announcing to another her heart beat quick on hearing harriet s footstep and voice so she supposed had poor mrs weston felt when _ she _ was approaching randalls could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance but of that unfortunately there could be no chance well miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into the room is not this the oddest news that ever was what news do you mean replied emma unable to guess by look or voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint about jane fairfax did you ever hear any thing so strange oh you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it what did mr weston tell you said emma still perplexed oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while how very odd it was indeed so odd harriet s behaviour was so extremely odd that emma did not know how to understand it her character appeared absolutely changed she seemed to propose shewing no agitation or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery emma looked at her quite unable to speak had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love with her you perhaps might you blushing as she spoke who can see into every body s heart but nobody else upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was tacitly if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelings i never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax you may be very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly me cried harriet colouring and astonished why should you caution me you do not think i care about mr frank churchill i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him him never never dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me turning away distressed harriet cried emma after a moment s pause what do you mean good heaven what do you mean mistake you am i to suppose then she could not speak another word her voice was lost and she sat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma s i should not have thought it possible she began that you could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person mr frank churchill indeed i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who is like nobody by his side and that you should have been so mistaken is amazing i am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words i should not have dared to give way to i should not have thought it possible but if _ you _ who had been always acquainted with him harriet cried emma collecting herself resolutely let us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake are you speaking of mr knightley to be sure i am i never could have an idea of any body else and so i thought you knew when we talked about him it was as clear as possible not quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person i could almost assert that you had _ named _ mr frank churchill i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of oh miss woodhouse how you do forget my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue the impression of it is strong on my memory oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time it was not the gipsies it was not mr frank churchill that i meant no with some elevation i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance of mr knightley s coming and asking me to dance when mr elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth good god cried emma this has been a most unfortunate most deplorable mistake what is to be done you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and now it _ is _ possible she paused a few moments emma could not speak i do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other but i hope miss woodhouse that supposing that if strange as it may appear but you know they were your own words that _ more _ wonderful things had happened matches of _ greater _ disparity had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to if mr knightley should really if _ he _ does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way but you are too good for that i am sure harriet was standing at one of the windows emma turned round to look at her in consternation and hastily said have you any idea of mr knightley s returning your affection yes replied harriet modestly but not fearfully i must say that i have emma s eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating in a fixed attitude for a few minutes a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart a mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress she touched she admitted she acknowledged the whole truth why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr knightley than with frank churchill why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriet s having some hope of a return it darted through her with the speed of an arrow that mr knightley must marry no one but herself her own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the same few minutes she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before how improperly had she been acting by harriet how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been her conduct what blindness what madness had led her on it struck her with dreadful force and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits some concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice by harriet there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by mr knightley but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindness for her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost extent of harriet s hopes should be enquired into and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained or to deserve to be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right rousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion she turned to harriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed the conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it the wonderful story of jane fairfax that was quite sunk and lost neither of them thought but of mr knightley and themselves harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge and such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation to give the history of her hopes with great though trembling delight emma s tremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than harriet s but they were not less her voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create she listened with much inward suffering but with great outward patience to harriet s detail methodical or well arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration a substance to sink her spirit especially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of mr knightley s most improved opinion of harriet harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances emma knew that he had on that occasion found her much superior to his expectation from that evening or at least from the time of miss woodhouse s encouraging her to think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness and sweetness latterly she had been more and more aware of it when they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very delightfully he seemed to want to be acquainted with her emma knew it to have been very much the case she had often observed the change to almost the same extent harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet he praised her for being without art or affectation for having simple honest generous feelings she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet he had dwelt on them to her more than once much that lived in harriet s memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected by emma circumstances that might swell to half an hour s relation and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not without some degree of witness from emma herself the first was his walking with her apart from the others in the lime walk at donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himself and at first he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before in a very particular way indeed harriet could not recall it without a blush he seemed to be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged but as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about farming the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at hartfield though when he first came in he had said that he could not stay five minutes and his having told her during their conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to _ her _ the superior degree of confidence towards harriet which this one article marked gave her severe pain on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did after a little reflection venture the following question might he not is not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martin he might have mr martin s interest in view but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it when harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope i never should have presumed to think of it at first said she but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emma s side to enable her to say on reply harriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her father s footsteps he was coming through the hall harriet was too much agitated to encounter him she could not compose herself mr woodhouse would be alarmed she had better go with most ready encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another door and the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of emma s feelings oh god that i had never seen her the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her thoughts she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours every moment had brought a fresh surprize and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her how to understand it all how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself and living under the blunders the blindness of her own head and heart she sat still she walked about she tried her own room she tried the shrubbery in every place every posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying that she was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour to that point went every leisure moment which her father s claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind how long had mr knightley been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be when had his influence such influence begun when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank churchill had once for a short period occupied she looked back she compared the two compared them as they had always stood in her estimation from the time of the latter s becoming known to her and as they must at any time have been compared by her had it oh had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear she saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own heart and in short that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection this was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which she reached and without being long in reaching it she was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her her affection for mr knightley every other part of her mind was disgusting with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body s feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body s destiny she was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothing for she had done mischief she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared on mr knightley were this most unequal of all connexions to take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harriet s and even were this not the case he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly mr knightley and harriet smith it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace threadbare stale in the comparison exciting no surprize presenting no disparity affording nothing to be said or thought mr knightley and harriet smith such an elevation on her side such a debasement on his it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion to foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt at his expense the mortification and disdain of his brother the thousand inconveniences to himself could it be no it was impossible and yet it was far very far from impossible was it a new circumstance for a man of first rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers was it new for one perhaps too busy to seek to be the prize of a girl who would seek him was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent incongruous or for chance and circumstance as second causes to direct the human fate oh had she never brought harriet forward had she left her where she ought and where he had told her she ought had she not with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong all would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr knightley how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it but harriet was less humble had fewer scruples than formerly her inferiority whether of mind or situation seemed little felt she had seemed more sensible of mr elton s being to stoop in marrying her than she now seemed of mr knightley s alas was not that her own doing too who had been at pains to give harriet notions of self consequence but herself who but herself had taught her that she was to elevate herself if possible and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment if harriet from being humble were grown vain it was her doing too chapter xii till now that she was threatened with its loss emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _ first _ with mr knightley first in interest and affection satisfied that it was so and feeling it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection and only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important it had been long very long she felt she had been first for having no female connexions of his own there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella she had herself been first with him for many years past she had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own but still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared in spite of all her faults she knew she was dear to him might she not say very dear when the suggestions of hope however which must follow here presented themselves she could not presume to indulge them harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly exclusively passionately loved by mr knightley _ she _ could not she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _ her _ she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates how directly how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject not too strongly for the offence but far far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear sighted goodwill she had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question but there was a hope at times a slight one at times much stronger that harriet might have deceived herself and be overrating his regard for _ her _ wish it she must for his sake be the consequence nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life could she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all she believed she should be perfectly satisfied let him but continue the same mr knightley to her and her father the same mr knightley to all the world let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence and her peace would be fully secured marriage in fact would not do for her it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father and with what she felt for him nothing should separate her from her father she would not marry even if she were asked by mr knightley it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed and she hoped that when able to see them together again she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were she should see them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here he was expected back every day the power of observation would be soon given frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course in the meanwhile she resolved against seeing harriet it would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good to be talking of it farther she was resolved not to be convinced as long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing harriet s confidence to talk would be only to irritate she wrote to her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not at present come to hartfield acknowledging it to be her conviction that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again except in the company of others she objected only to a tête à tête they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday harriet submitted and approved and was grateful this point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear emma s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twenty four hours mrs weston who had been calling on her daughter in law elect and took hartfield in her way home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview mr weston had accompanied her to mrs bates s and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs bates s parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded a little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while her friend related mrs weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed and mr churchill could be reconciled to the engagement s becoming known as considering every thing she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports but mr weston had thought differently he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were that it would be of any consequence for such things he observed always got about emma smiled and felt that mr weston had very good reason for saying so they had gone in short and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady she had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness the quiet heart felt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her daughter who proved even too joyous to talk as usual had been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene they were both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation thought so much of jane so much of every body and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them miss fairfax s recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs weston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and declined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the course of their drive mrs weston had by gentle encouragement overcome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse on the important subject apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr weston must necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement mrs weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so many months continued mrs weston she was energetic this was one of her expressions i will not say that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments but i can say that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour and the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation that i felt at my heart poor girl said emma she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement wrong no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself the consequence said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct pain is no expiation i never can be blameless i have been acting contrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken and the kindness i am now receiving is what my conscience tells me ought not to be do not imagine madam she continued that i was taught wrong do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up the error has been all my own and i do assure you that with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell poor girl said emma again she loves him then excessively i suppose it must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement her affection must have overpowered her judgment yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him i am afraid returned emma sighing that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy on your side my love it was very innocently done but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was that of making her _ unreasonable _ the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had been hard for him to bear i did not make the allowances said she which i ought to have done for his temper and spirits his delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank you i could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself if i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not bear these thanks for oh mrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax well checking herself and trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars they shew her to the greatest advantage i am sure she is very good i hope she will be very happy it is fit that the fortune should be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs weston she thought well of frank in almost every respect and what was more she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest she talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection but she had too much to urge for emma s attention it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when mrs weston ended with we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for are you well my emma was mrs weston s parting question oh perfectly i am always well you know be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible mrs weston s communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause had she followed mr knightley s known wishes in paying that attention to miss fairfax which was every way her due had she tried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith she must in all probability have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now birth abilities and education had been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received with gratitude and the other what was she supposing even that they had never become intimate friends that she had never been admitted into miss fairfax s confidence on this important matter which was most probable still in knowing her as she ought and as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr dixon which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so unpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane s feelings by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill s of all the sources of evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst she must have been a perpetual enemy they never could have been all three together without her having stabbed jane fairfax s peace in a thousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield the weather added what it could of gloom a cold stormy rain set in and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights the longer visible the weather affected mr woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter s side and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before it reminded her of their first forlorn tête à tête on the evening of mrs weston s wedding day but mr knightley had walked in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy alas such delightful proofs of hartfield s attraction as those sort of visits conveyed might shortly be over the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lost but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction the prospect before her now was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled that might not be even partially brightened if all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must be comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself and mrs weston s heart and time would be occupied by it they should lose her and probably in great measure her husband also frank churchill would return among them no more and miss fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease to belong to highbury they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe all that were good would be withdrawn and if to these losses the loss of donwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach mr knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort no longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change his own home for their s how was it to be endured and if he were to be lost to them for harriet s sake if he were to be thought of hereafter as finding in harriet s society all that he wanted if harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence what could be increasing emma s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her own work when it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a few seconds and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone chapter xiii the weather continued much the same all the following morning and the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to reign at hartfield but in the afternoon it cleared the wind changed into a softer quarter the clouds were carried off the sun appeared it was summer again with all the eagerness which such a transition gives emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible never had the exquisite sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm been more attractive to her she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce and on mr perry s coming in soon after dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery there with spirits freshened and thoughts a little relieved she had taken a few turns when she saw mr knightley passing through the garden door and coming towards her it was the first intimation of his being returned from london she had been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles distant there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind she must be collected and calm in half a minute they were together the how d ye do s were quiet and constrained on each side she asked after their mutual friends they were all well when had he left them only that morning he must have had a wet ride yes he meant to walk with her she found he had just looked into the dining room and as he was not wanted there preferred being out of doors she thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible cause for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner in which they had been received they walked together he was silent she thought he was often looking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give and this belief produced another dread perhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to harriet he might be watching for encouragement to begin she did not could not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject he must do it all himself yet she could not bear this silence with him it was most unnatural she considered resolved and trying to smile began you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you have i said he quietly and looking at her of what nature oh the best nature in the world a wedding after waiting a moment as if to be sure she intended to say no more he replied if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already how is it possible cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards him for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs goddard s in his way i had a few lines on parish business from mr weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened emma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little more composure _ you _ probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution i wish i had attended to it but with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh i seem to have been doomed to blindness for a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low time my dearest emma time will heal the wound your own excellent sense your exertions for your father s sake i know you will not allow yourself her arm was pressed again as he added in a more broken and subdued accent the feelings of the warmest friendship indignation abominable scoundrel and in a louder steadier tone he concluded with he will soon be gone they will soon be in yorkshire i am sorry for _ her _ she deserves a better fate emma understood him and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied you are very kind but you are mistaken and i must set you right i am not in want of that sort of compassion my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier emma cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed but checking himself no no i understand you forgive me i am pleased that you can say even so much he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled i could never i confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt i could only be certain that there was a preference and a preference which i never believed him to deserve he is a disgrace to the name of man and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman jane jane you will be a miserable creature mr knightley said emma trying to be lively but really confused i am in a very extraordinary situation i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse but i never have he listened in perfect silence she wished him to speak but he would not she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion she went on however i have very little to say for my own conduct i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased an old story probably a common case and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding many circumstances assisted the temptation he was the son of mr weston he was continually here i always found him very pleasant and in short for with a sigh let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions latterly however for some time indeed i have had no idea of their meaning any thing i thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side he has imposed on me but he has not injured me i have never been attached to him and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour he never wished to attach me it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself except that i was _ not _ blinded that it was my good fortune that in short i was somehow or other safe from him she had hoped for an answer here for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible but he was silent and as far as she could judge deep in thought at last and tolerably in his usual tone he said i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill i can suppose however that i may have underrated him my acquaintance with him has been but trifling and even if i have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well with such a woman he has a chance i have no motive for wishing him ill and for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him well i have no doubt of their being happy together said emma i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached he is a most fortunate man returned mr knightley with energy so early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three and twenty to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for jane fairfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation i mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of _ her _ regard must i think be the happiest of mortals frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune every thing turns out for his good he meets with a young woman at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior his aunt is in the way his aunt dies he has only to speak his friends are eager to promote his happiness he had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him he is a fortunate man indeed you speak as if you envied him and i do envy him emma in one respect he is the object of my envy emma could say no more they seemed to be within half a sentence of harriet and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject if possible she made her plan she would speak of something totally different the children in brunswick square and she only waited for breath to begin when mr knightley startled her by saying you will not ask me what is the point of envy you are determined i see to have no curiosity you are wise but _ i _ cannot be wise emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment oh then don t speak it don t speak it she eagerly cried take a little time consider do not commit yourself thank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not another syllable followed emma could not bear to give him pain he was wishing to confide in her perhaps to consult her cost her what it would she would listen she might assist his resolution or reconcile him to it she might give just praise to harriet or by representing to him his own independence relieve him from that state of indecision which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his they had reached the house you are going in i suppose said he no replied emma quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke i should like to take another turn mr perry is not gone and after proceeding a few steps she added i stopped you ungraciously just now mr knightley and i am afraid gave you pain but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation as a friend indeed you may command me i will hear whatever you like i will tell you exactly what i think as a friend repeated mr knightley emma that i fear is a word no i have no wish stay yes why should i hesitate i have gone too far already for concealment emma i accept your offer extraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you as a friend tell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding he stopped in his earnestness to look the question and the expression of his eyes overpowered her my dearest emma said he for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hour s conversation my dearest most beloved emma tell me at once say no if it is to be said she could really say nothing you are silent he cried with great animation absolutely silent at present i ask no more emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream was perhaps the most prominent feeling i cannot make speeches emma he soon resumed and in a tone of such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing if i loved you less i might be able to talk about it more but you know what i am you hear nothing but truth from me i have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them god knows i have been a very indifferent lover but you understand me yes you see you understand my feelings and will return them if you can at present i ask only to hear once to hear your voice while he spoke emma s mind was most busy and with all the wonderful velocity of thought had been able and yet without losing a word to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole to see that harriet s hopes had been entirely groundless a mistake a delusion as complete a delusion as any of her own that harriet was nothing that she was every thing herself that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance her discouragement had been all received as discouragement from herself and not only was there time for these convictions with all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to rejoice that harriet s secret had not escaped her and to resolve that it need not and should not it was all the service she could now render her poor friend for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the two or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever without vouchsafing any motive because he could not marry them both emma had it not she felt for harriet with pain and with contrition but no flight of generosity run mad opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain she had led her friend astray and it would be a reproach to her for ever but her judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever been before in reprobating any such alliance for him as most unequal and degrading her way was clear though not quite smooth she spoke then on being so entreated what did she say just what she ought of course a lady always does she said enough to shew there need not be despair and to invite him to say more himself he _ had _ despaired at one period he had received such an injunction to caution and silence as for the time crushed every hope she had begun by refusing to hear him the change had perhaps been somewhat sudden her proposal of taking another turn her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to might be a little extraordinary she felt its inconsistency but mr knightley was so obliging as to put up with it and seek no farther explanation seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material mr knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his he had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it he had come in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill s engagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel her the rest had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill of her having a heart completely disengaged from him had given birth to the hope that in time he might gain her affection himself but it had been no present hope he had only in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her the superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting the affection which he had been asking to be allowed to create if he could was already his within half an hour he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind to something so like perfect happiness that it could bear no other name _ her _ change was equal this one half hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust on his side there had been a long standing jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of frank churchill he had been in love with emma and jealous of frank churchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the country the box hill party had decided him on going away he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted encouraged attentions he had gone to learn to be indifferent but he had gone to a wrong place there was too much domestic happiness in his brother s house woman wore too amiable a form in it isabella was too much like emma differing only in those striking inferiorities which always brought the other in brilliancy before him for much to have been done even had his time been longer he had stayed on however vigorously day after day till this very morning s post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax then with the gladness which must be felt nay which he did not scruple to feel having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma was there so much fond solicitude so much keen anxiety for her that he could stay no longer he had ridden home through the rain and had walked up directly after dinner to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures faultless in spite of all her faults bore the discovery he had found her agitated and low frank churchill was a villain he heard her declare that she had never loved him frank churchill s character was not desperate she was his own emma by hand and word when they returned into the house and if he could have thought of frank churchill then he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow chapter xiv what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought out she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away they sat down to tea the same party round the same table how often it had been collected and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun but never in such a state of spirits never in any thing like it and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house or even the attentive daughter poor mr woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride could he have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr perry and talked on with much self contentment totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return as long as mr knightley remained with them emma s fever continued but when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued and in the course of the sleepless night which was the tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious points to consider as made her feel that even her happiness must have some alloy her father and harriet she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question with respect to her father it was a question soon answered she hardly knew yet what mr knightley would ask but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father she even wept over the idea of it as a sin of thought while he lived it must be only an engagement but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him how to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision how to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make her any possible atonement how to appear least her enemy on these subjects her perplexity and distress were very great and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it she could only resolve at last that she would still avoid a meeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from highbury and indulging in one scheme more nearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to brunswick square isabella had been pleased with harriet and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement she did not think it in harriet s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety by the streets the shops and the children at any rate it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself from whom every thing was due a separation for the present an averting of the evil day when they must all be together again she rose early and wrote her letter to harriet an employment which left her so very serious so nearly sad that mr knightley in walking up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before he had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter was brought her from randalls a very thick letter she guessed what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill she wanted no explanations she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself and as for understanding any thing he wrote she was sure she was incapable of it it must be waded through however she opened the packet it was too surely so a note from mrs weston to herself ushered in the letter from frank to mrs weston i have the greatest pleasure my dear emma in forwarding to you the enclosed i know what thorough justice you will do it and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again but i will not delay you by a long preface we are quite well this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have been feeling lately i did not quite like your looks on tuesday but it was an ungenial morning and though you will never own being affected by weather i think every body feels a north east wind i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning but had the comfort of hearing last night by mr perry that it had not made him ill yours ever a w _ to mrs weston _ windsor july my dear madam if i made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be expected but expected or not i know it will be read with candour and indulgence you are all goodness and i believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent my courage rises while i write it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble i have already met with such success in two applications for pardon that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence you must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards this was the fact my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment is another question i shall not discuss it here for my temptation to _ think _ it a right i refer every caviller to a brick house sashed windows below and casements above in highbury i dared not address her openly my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to require definition and i was fortunate enough to prevail before we parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement had she refused i should have gone mad but you will be ready to say what was your hope in doing this what did you look forward to to any thing every thing to time chance circumstance slow effects sudden bursts perseverance and weariness health and sickness every possibility of good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence if you need farther explanation i have the honour my dear madam of being your husband s son and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of see me then under these circumstances arriving on my first visit to randalls and here i am conscious of wrong for that visit might have been sooner paid you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax was in highbury and as _ you _ were the person slighted you will forgive me instantly but i must work on my father s compassion by reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house so long i lost the blessing of knowing you my behaviour during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you did not i hope lay me open to reprehension excepting on one point and now i come to the principal the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation with the greatest respect and the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse my father perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought in order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible object but i am sure you will believe the declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much my conviction as my wish she received my attentions with an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me we seemed to understand each other from our relative situation those attentions were her due and were felt to be so whether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight i cannot say when i called to take leave of her i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth and i then fancied she was not without suspicion but i have no doubt of her having since detected me at least in some degree she may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must have penetrated a part i cannot doubt it you will find whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints that it did not take her wholly by surprize she frequently gave me hints of it i remember her telling me at the ball that i owed mrs elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse i could deserve nothing from either acquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have now a key to my heart was in highbury and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account of the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to you will soon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself no description can describe her she must tell you herself what she is yet not by word for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit since i began this letter which will be longer than i foresaw i have heard from her she gives a good account of her own health but as she never complains i dare not depend i want to have your opinion of her looks i know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit perhaps it is paid already let me hear from you without delay i am impatient for a thousand particulars remember how few minutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state and i am not much better yet still insane either from happiness or misery when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with of her excellence and patience and my uncle s generosity i am mad with joy but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her and how little i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger if i could but see her again but i must not propose it yet my uncle has been too good for me to encroach i must still add to this long letter you have not heard all that you ought to hear i could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out needs explanation for though the event of the 26th ult as you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects i should not have presumed on such early measures but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement but i had no choice the hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman here my dear madam i was obliged to leave off abruptly to recollect and compose myself i have been walking over the country and am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be it is in fact a most mortifying retrospect for me i behaved shamefully and here i can admit that my manners to miss w in being unpleasant to miss f were highly blameable _ she _ disapproved them which ought to have been enough my plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient she was displeased i thought unreasonably so i thought her on a thousand occasions unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious i thought her even cold but she was always right if i had followed her judgment and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known we quarrelled do you remember the morning spent at donwell _ there _ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis i was late i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she would not suffer it she absolutely refused to allow me which i then thought most unreasonable now however i see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion while i to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless had we been met walking together between donwell and highbury the truth must have been suspected i was mad enough however to resent i doubted her affection i doubted it more the next day on box hill when provoked by such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her and such apparent devotion to miss w as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me in short my dear madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side abominable on mine and i returned the same evening to richmond though i might have staid with you till the next morning merely because i would be as angry with her as possible even then i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time but i was the injured person injured by her coldness and i went away determined that she should make the first advances i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party had you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced as soon as she found i was really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that officious mrs elton the whole system of whose treatment of her by the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself but otherwise i should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known jane indeed you will observe that i have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you think then what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority have patience with me i shall soon have done she closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again _ she _ _ felt _ _ the _ _ engagement _ _ to _ _ be _ _ a _ _ source _ _ of _ _ repentance _ _ and _ _ misery _ _ to _ _ each _ _ she _ _ dissolved _ _ it _ this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt s death i answered it within an hour but from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in my writing desk and i trusting that i had written enough though but a few lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness i was rather disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily but i made excuses for her and was too busy and may i add too cheerful in my views to be captious we removed to windsor and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters all returned and a few lines at the same time by the post stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last and adding that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible she now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested that if i could not directly command hers so as to send them to highbury within a week i would forward them after that period to her at in short the full direction to mr smallridge s near bristol stared me in the face i knew the name the place i knew all about it and instantly saw what she had been doing it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess and the secrecy she had maintained as to any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy for the world would not she have seemed to threaten me imagine the shock imagine how till i had actually detected my own blunder i raved at the blunders of the post what was to be done one thing only i must speak to my uncle without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again i spoke circumstances were in my favour the late event had softened away his pride and he was earlier than i could have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying and could say at last poor man with a deep sigh that he wished i might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done i felt that it would be of a different sort are you disposed to pity me for what i must have suffered in opening the cause to him for my suspense while all was at stake no do not pity me till i reached highbury and saw how ill i had made her do not pity me till i saw her wan sick looks i reached highbury at the time of day when from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour i was certain of a good chance of finding her alone i was not disappointed and at last i was not disappointed either in the object of my journey a great deal of very reasonable very just displeasure i had to persuade away but it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no moment s uneasiness can ever occur between us again now my dear madam i will release you but i could not conclude before a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her if you think me in a way to be happier than i deserve i am quite of your opinion miss w calls me the child of good fortune i hope she is right in one respect my good fortune is undoubted that of being able to subscribe myself your obliged and affectionate son f c weston churchill chapter xv this letter must make its way to emma s feelings she was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that mrs weston foretold as soon as she came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment she never stopt till she had gone through the whole and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed and he had suffered and was very sorry and he was so grateful to mrs weston and so much in love with miss fairfax and she was so happy herself that there was no being severe and could he have entered the room she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever she thought so well of the letter that when mr knightley came again she desired him to read it she was sure of mrs weston s wishing it to be communicated especially to one who like mr knightley had seen so much to blame in his conduct i shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long i will take it home with me at night but that would not do mr weston was to call in the evening and she must return it by him i would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done he began stopping however almost directly to say had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference he proceeded a little farther reading to himself and then with a smile observed humph a fine complimentary opening but it is his way one man s style must not be the rule of another s we will not be severe it will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my opinion aloud as i read by doing it i shall feel that i am near you it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it not at all i should wish it mr knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity he trifles here said he as to the temptation he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge bad he ought not to have formed the engagement his father s disposition he is unjust however to his father mr weston s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here and i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma but yet i think had _ you _ not been in the case i should still have distrusted him when he came to miss woodhouse he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud all that related to her with a smile a look a shake of the head a word or two of assent or disapprobation or merely of love as the subject required concluding however seriously and after steady reflection thus very bad though it might have been worse playing a most dangerous game too much indebted to the event for his acquittal no judge of his own manners by you always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience fancying you to have fathomed his secret natural enough his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others mystery finesse how they pervert the understanding my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on harriet s account which she could not give any sincere explanation of you had better go on said she he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure a boyish scheme indeed i cannot comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could after this he made some progress without any pause frank churchill s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing i perfectly agree with you sir was then his remark you did behave very shamefully you never wrote a truer line and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfax s sense of right he made a fuller pause to say this is very bad he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party and grew uncomfortable her own behaviour had been so very improper she was deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look it was all read however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark and excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear of giving pain no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons was his next observation his feelings are natural what actually resolve to break with him entirely she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour well he must be a most extraordinary nay nay read on you will find how very much he suffers i hope he does replied mr knightley coolly and resuming the letter smallridge what does this mean what is all this she had engaged to go as governess to mrs smallridge s children a dear friend of mrs elton s a neighbour of maple grove and by the bye i wonder how mrs elton bears the disappointment say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read not even of mrs elton only one page more i shall soon have done what a letter the man writes i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him well there _ is _ feeling here he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her dearer much dearer than ever i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands happier than i deserve come he knows himself there miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune those were miss woodhouse s words were they and a fine ending and there is the letter the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am but still you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it i hope it does him some service with you yes certainly it does he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants and now let me talk to you of something else i have another person s interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject the subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english such as mr knightley used even to the woman he was in love with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the happiness of her father emma s answer was ready at the first word while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her she could never quit him part only of this answer however was admitted the impossibility of her quitting her father mr knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to he had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce mr woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father s comfort perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded mr woodhouse taken from hartfield no he felt that it ought not to be attempted but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable it was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as her father s happiness in other words his life required hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise of their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own passing thoughts like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her she was sensible of all the affection it evinced she felt that in quitting donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with she promised to think of it and advised him to think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject he had given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning to have his thoughts to himself ah there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma i am sure william larkins will not like it you must get his consent before you ask mine she promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax or any body else which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield the more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became his evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase their mutual good to outweigh every drawback such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy she would have been too happy but for poor harriet but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself poor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a distance from she would be a loser in every way emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment in such a party harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise but for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment in time of course mr knightley would be forgotten that is supplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early mr knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure not like mr elton mr knightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she could be in love with more than _ three _ men in one year chapter xvi it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting their intercourse was painful enough by letter how much worse had they been obliged to meet harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent sense of ill usage and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate it might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke she had no difficulty in procuring isabella s invitation and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it without resorting to invention there was a tooth amiss harriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist mrs john knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her and though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr wingfield she was quite eager to have harriet under her care when it was thus settled on her sister s side emma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable harriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was to be conveyed in mr woodhouse s carriage it was all arranged it was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick square now emma could indeed enjoy mr knightley s visits now she could talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her how much might at that moment and at a little distance be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself the difference of harriet at mrs goddard s or in london made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma s sensations but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied there was a communication before her one which _ she _ only could be competent to make the confession of her engagement to her father but she would have nothing to do with it at present she had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs weston were safe and well no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time a fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers she soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax she ought to go and she was longing to see her the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill it would be a _ secret _ satisfaction but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate she went she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected the fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name she heard patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible no she heard nothing but the instant reply of beg her to walk up and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient emma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging there was consciousness animation and warmth there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted she came forward with an offered hand and said in a low but very feeling tone this is most kind indeed miss woodhouse it is impossible for me to express i hope you will believe excuse me for being so entirely without words emma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words if the sound of mrs elton s voice from the sitting room had not checked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest shake of the hand mrs bates and mrs elton were together miss bates was out which accounted for the previous tranquillity emma could have wished mrs elton elsewhere but she was in a humour to have patience with every body and as mrs elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs elton s thoughts and understand why she was like herself in happy spirits it was being in miss fairfax s confidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face and while paying her own compliments to mrs bates and appearing to attend to the good old lady s replies she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods we can h this some other time you know you and i shall not want opportunities and in fact you have heard all the essential already i only wanted to prove to you that mrs s admits our apology and is not offended you see how delightfully she writes oh she is a sweet creature you would have doated on her had you gone but not a word more let us be discreet quite on our good behaviour hush you remember those lines i forget the poem at this moment for when a lady s in the case you know all other things give place now i say my dear in _ our _ case for _ lady _ read mum a word to the wise i am in a fine flow of spirits an t i but i want to set your heart at ease as to mrs s _ my _ representation you see has quite appeased her and again on emma s merely turning her head to look at mrs bates s knitting she added in a half whisper i mentioned no _ names _ you will observe oh no cautious as a minister of state i managed it extremely well emma could not doubt it was a palpable display repeated on every possible occasion when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs weston she found herself abruptly addressed with do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit here was a side glance of great meaning at jane upon my word perry has restored her in a wonderful short time oh if you had seen her as i did when she was at the worst and when mrs bates was saying something to emma whispered farther we do not say a word of any _ assistance _ that perry might have not a word of a certain young physician from windsor oh no perry shall have all the credit i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill very pleasant party but yet i think there was something wanting things did not seem that is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some so it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken however i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again what say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lasts it must be the same party you know quite the same party not _ one _ exception soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness it is impossible to say yes indeed i quite understand dearest jane s prospects that is i do not mean but she is charmingly recovered how is mr woodhouse i am so glad quite out of my power such a happy little circle as you find us here yes indeed charming young man that is so very friendly i mean good mr perry such attention to jane and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcome after a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess mrs elton speaking louder said yes here i am my good friend and here i have been so long that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise but the truth is that i am waiting for my lord and master he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr elton s time is so engaged upon my word it is miss bates he really is engaged from morning to night there is no end of people s coming to him on some pretence or other the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion they seem not able to do any thing without him upon my word mr e i often say rather you than i i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if i had half so many applicants bad enough as it is for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight however he is coming i assure you yes indeed on purpose to wait on you all and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma a congratulatory visit you know oh yes quite indispensable miss bates looked about her so happily he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation mr e is knightley s right hand emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is mr elton gone on foot to donwell he will have a hot walk oh no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting weston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only of those who lead i fancy mr e and knightley have every thing their own way have not you mistaken the day said emma i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow mr knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday oh no the meeting is certainly to day was the abrupt answer which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs elton s side i do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever was we never heard of such things at maple grove your parish there was small said jane upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject talked of but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than five and twenty children ah you clever creature that s very true what a thinking brain you have i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we could be shaken together my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection not that i presume to insinuate however that _ some _ people may not think _ you _ perfection already but hush not a word if you please it seemed an unnecessary caution jane was wanting to give her words not to mrs elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look mr elton made his appearance his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted mr elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away his civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the walk he had had for nothing when i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found very odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one donwell cried his wife my dear mr e you have not been to donwell you mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown no no that s to morrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley to day on that very account such a dreadful broiling morning i went over the fields too speaking in a tone of great ill usage which made it so much the worse and then not to find him at home i assure you i am not at all pleased and no apology left no message for me the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected very extraordinary and nobody knew at all which way he was gone perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods miss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley can you explain it emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him i cannot imagine said mrs elton feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten my dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he must not even knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never sent it i met william larkins continued mr elton as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him william seemed rather out of humour he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with william s wants but it really is of very great importance that _ i _ should see knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly in all probability she was at this very time waited for there and mr knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr elton if not towards william larkins she was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of to say it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent oh cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure there would have been no danger the danger would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest indeed miss woodhouse speaking more collectedly with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to i have not time for half that i could wish to say i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself i feel it so very due but unfortunately in short if your compassion does not stand my friend oh you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly and taking her hand you owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you so cold and artificial i had always a part to act it was a life of deceit i know that i must have disgusted you pray say no more i feel that all the apologies should be on my side let us forgive each other at once we must do whatever is to be done quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor very and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose you just as i begin to know you oh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma smiling but excuse me it must be thought of the smile was returned as jane answered you are very right it has been thought of and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for thank you thank you this is just what i wanted to be assured of oh if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open good bye good bye chapter xvii mrs weston s friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased to emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabella s sons but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best it would be a great comfort to mr weston as he grew older and even mr weston might be growing older ten years hence to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home and mrs weston no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again she has had the advantage you know of practising on me she continued like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan that is replied mr knightley she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all it will be the only difference poor child cried emma at that rate what will become of her nothing very bad the fate of thousands she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma i who am owing all my happiness to _ you _ would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them emma laughed and replied but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it do you i have no doubt nature gave you understanding miss taylor gave you principles you must have done well my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner i do not believe i did you any good the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least i am sure you were of use to me cried emma i was very often influenced rightly by you oftener than i would own at the time i am very sure you did me good and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks mr knightley i am going to do so and so papa says i may or i have miss taylor s leave something which you knew i did not approve in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one what an amiable creature i was no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance mr knightley you always called me mr knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound and yet it is formal i want you to call me something else but i do not know what i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again and cannot you call me george now impossible i never can call you any thing but mr knightley i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton by calling you mr k but i will promise she added presently laughing and blushing i will promise to call you once by your christian name i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where in the building in which n takes m for better for worse emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies her wilful intimacy with harriet smith but it was too tender a subject she could not enter on it harriet was very seldom mentioned between them this on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining she was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on isabella s letters he might observe that it was so the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to be consulted but since that business had been over she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before isabella to be sure was no very quick observer yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children it would not have escaped her emma s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on by harriet s being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be a month at least mr and mrs john knightley were to come down in august and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back john does not even mention your friend said mr knightley here is his answer if you like to see it it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned john enters like a brother into my happiness continued mr knightley but he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes he writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read the letter i honour his sincerity it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him my emma he means no such thing he only means he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two interrupted she with a sort of serious smile much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject emma my dear emma oh she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion depend upon it he will be much farther from doing _ you _ justice he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther ah he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together i am amused by one part of john s letter did you notice it where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying he had no idea of me he seems perfectly unprepared for that yes yes but i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings what has he been judging by i am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another but it was so i suppose i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual i remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons reception of it tried as soon as mrs weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr woodhouse s visits emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to announce it at home and then at randalls but how to break it to her father at last she had bound herself to do it in such an hour of mr knightley s absence or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her and she must have put it off but mr knightley was to come at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to make she was forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself she must not appear to think it a misfortune with all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all she and mr knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person s company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs weston best in the world poor man it was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it she was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of poor isabella and poor miss taylor but it would not do emma hung about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs weston whose marriages taking them from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change but she was not going from hartfield she should be always there she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having mr knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea did he not love mr knightley very much he would not deny that he did she was sure whom did he ever want to consult on business but mr knightley who was so useful to him who so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist him who so cheerful so attentive so attached to him would not he like to have him always on the spot yes that was all very true mr knightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see him every day but they did see him every day as it was why could not they go on as they had done mr woodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome the idea was given time and continual repetition must do the rest to emma s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr knightley s whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome and he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion they had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest approbation and mrs weston was ready on the first meeting to consider the subject in the most serviceable light first as a settled and secondly as a good one well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr woodhouse s mind it was agreed upon as what was to be and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other in another year or two perhaps it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place mrs weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event she had been extremely surprized never more so than when emma first opened the affair to her but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost she had such a regard for mr knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest emma and it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable a connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it long ago how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield and who but mr knightley could know and bear with mr woodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirable the difficulty of disposing of poor mr woodhouse had been always felt in her husband s plans and her own for a marriage between frank and emma how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impediment less acknowledged by mr weston than by herself but even he had never been able to h the subject better than by saying those matters will take care of themselves the young people will find a way but here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future it was all right all open all equal no sacrifice on any side worth the name it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it mrs weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections as these was one of the happiest women in the world if any thing could increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread and mr weston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind he saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it it is to be a secret i conclude said he these matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them only let me be told when i may speak out i wonder whether jane has any suspicion he went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on that point he told her the news was not she like a daughter his eldest daughter he must tell her and miss bates being present it passed of course to mrs cole mrs perry and mrs elton immediately afterwards it was no more than the principals were prepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls how soon it would be over highbury and were thinking of themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle with great sagacity in general it was a very well approved match some might think him and others might think her the most in luck one set might recommend their all removing to donwell and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys and another might predict disagreements among their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one habitation the vicarage there the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction mr elton cared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the young lady s pride would now be contented and supposed she had always meant to catch knightley if she could and on the point of living at hartfield could daringly exclaim rather he than i but mrs elton was very much discomposed indeed poor knightley poor fellow sad business for him she was extremely concerned for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities how could he be so taken in did not think him at all in love not in the least poor knightley there would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him but that would be all over now poor fellow no more exploring parties to donwell made for _ her _ oh no there would be a mrs knightley to throw cold water on every thing extremely disagreeable but she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day shocking plan living together it would never do she knew a family near maple grove who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter chapter xviii time passed on a few more to morrows and the party from london would be arriving it was an alarming change and emma was thinking of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when mr knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by after the first chat of pleasure he was silent and then in a graver tone began with i have something to tell you emma some news good or bad said she quickly looking up in his face i do not know which it ought to be called oh good i am sure i see it in your countenance you are trying not to smile i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it indeed but why so i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which we do not think alike he paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on her face does nothing occur to you do not you recollect harriet smith her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though she knew not what have you heard from her yourself this morning cried he you have i believe and know the whole no i have not i know nothing pray tell me you are prepared for the worst i see and very bad it is harriet smith marries robert martin emma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared and her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible but her lips were closed it is so indeed continued mr knightley i have it from robert martin himself he left me not half an hour ago she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement you like it my emma as little as i feared i wish our opinions were the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it it seems an impossibility you cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again yet you only mean that he intends it i mean that he has done it answered mr knightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted good god she cried well then having recourse to her workbasket in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing she added well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me how where when let me know it all i never was more surprized but it does not make me unhappy i assure you how how has it been possible it is a very simple story he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s the party was to be our brother and sister henry john and miss smith my friend robert could not resist they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving he came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own this is all that i can relate of the how where and when your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her she will give you all the minute particulars which only woman s language can make interesting in our communications we deal only in the great however i must say that robert martin s heart seemed for _ him _ and to _ me _ very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astley s my brother took charge of mrs john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy he stopped emma dared not attempt any immediate reply to speak she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness she must wait a moment or he would think her mad her silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while he added emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected his situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more his good sense and good principles would delight you as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma you laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin he wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly she did cheerfully answering you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match i think harriet is doing extremely well _ her _ connexions may be worse than _ his _ in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unprepared i was for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before you ought to know your friend best replied mr knightley but i should say she was a good tempered soft hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i do but mr knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him i could suppose she might in time but can she already did not you misunderstand him you were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him it was not harriet s hand that he was certain of it was the dimensions of some famous ox the contrast between the countenance and air of mr knightley and robert martin was at this moment so strong to emma s feelings and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriet s side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis no i hope i know better than to think of robert martin that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature it could not be otherwise do you dare say this cried mr knightley do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of what do you deserve oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr martin and harriet now are i am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard i assured him that i could not then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day i am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles and most sincerely wish them happy you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before i hope so for at that time i was a fool and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet s good qualities i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martin s sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her i have often talked to her a good deal you must have seen that i did sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin s cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for me cried emma shaking her head ah poor harriet she checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father she was not sorry she wanted to be alone her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be collected she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits and till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she could be fit for nothing rational her father s business was to announce james s being gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harriet s welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security what had she to wish for nothing but to grow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst of them she must laugh at such a close such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back such a heart such a harriet now there would be pleasure in her returning every thing would be a pleasure it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr knightley would soon be over the disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father not always listening but always agreeing to what he said and whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day or poor mrs weston would be disappointed they arrived mrs weston was alone in the drawing room but hardly had they been told of the baby and mr woodhouse received the thanks for coming which he asked for when a glimpse was caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window it is frank and miss fairfax said mrs weston i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning he stays till to morrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us they are coming in i hope in half a minute they were in the room emma was extremely glad to see him but there was a degree of confusion a number of embarrassing recollections on each side they met readily and smiling but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure when mr weston joined the party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animation or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs weston s letters i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon i hope you do not retract what you then said no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness is not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards jane better than she ever used to do you see how my father and mrs weston doat upon her but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named the name of dixon emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing i can never think of it she cried without extreme shame the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be but is it possible that you had no suspicion i mean of late early i know you had none i never had the smallest i assure you that appears quite wonderful i was once very near and i wish i had it would have been better but though i was always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing it is not now worth a regret said emma i have some hope resumed he of my uncle s being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust till we may carry her northward but now i am at such a distance from her is not it hard miss woodhouse till this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation do not you pity me emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay thought he cried ah by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the moment i hope mr knightley is well he paused she coloured and laughed i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour let me return your congratulations i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane and his next words were did you ever see such a skin such smoothness such delicacy and yet without being actually fair one cannot call her fair it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye lashes and hair a most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly the lady in it just colour enough for beauty i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale when we first began to talk of her have you quite forgotten oh no what an impudent dog i was how could i dare but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could not help saying i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all i am sure you had i am sure it was a consolation to you oh no no no how can you suspect me of such a thing i was the most miserable wretch not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation i think there is a little likeness between us he bowed if not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of true sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own true true he answered warmly no not true on your side you can have no superior but most true on mine she is a complete angel look at her is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn of her throat observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father you will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels they are to be new set i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head will not it be beautiful in her dark hair very beautiful indeed replied emma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out how delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such excellent looks i would not have missed this meeting for the world i should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come the others had been talking of the child mrs weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under the evening before from the infant s appearing not quite well she believed she had been foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr perry perhaps she ought to be ashamed but mr weston had been almost as uneasy as herself in ten minutes however the child had been perfectly well again this was her history and particularly interesting it was to mr woodhouse who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry and only regretted that she had not done it she should always send for perry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment she could not be too soon alarmed nor send for perry too often it was a pity perhaps that he had not come last night for though the child seemed well now very well considering it would probably have been better if perry had seen it frank churchill caught the name perry said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss fairfax s eye my friend mr perry what are they saying about mr perry has he been here this morning and how does he travel now has he set up his carriage emma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined in the laugh it was evident from jane s countenance that she too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf such an extraordinary dream of mine he cried i can never think of it without laughing she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown look at her do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye that the whole blunder is spread before her that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others jane was forced to smile completely for a moment and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet steady voice how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me they _ will _ sometimes obtrude but how you can court them he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but emma s feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on leaving randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of mr knightley s high superiority of character the happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced chapter xix if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr knightley and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty a very few days brought the party from london and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfied unaccountable as it was that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr knightley and was now forming all her views of happiness harriet was a little distressed did look a little foolish at first but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and self deceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to her friend s approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astley s and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight but what did such particulars explain the fact was as emma could now acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert martin and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible beyond this it must ever be unintelligible to emma the event however was most joyful and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so harriet s parentage became known she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to have always wished for concealment such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for it was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many a gentleman but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr knightley or for the churchills or even for mr elton the stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth would have been a stain indeed no objection was raised on the father s side the young man was treated liberally it was all as it should be and as emma became acquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend she had no doubt of harriet s happiness with any good tempered man but with him and in the home he offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and improvement she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself retired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness she would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out she would be respectable and happy and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man or if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins was less and less at hartfield which was not to be regretted the intimacy between her and emma must sink their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought to be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural manner before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction as no remembrances even connected with mr elton as he stood before them could impair perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw mr elton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself robert martin and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells the mr churchills were also in town and they were only waiting for november the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by emma and mr knightley they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield to allow them the fortnight s absence in a tour to the seaside which was the plan john and isabella and every other friend were agreed in approving it but mr woodhouse how was mr woodhouse to be induced to consent he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were almost hopeless a second allusion indeed gave less pain he began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent it a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation still however he was not happy nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughter s courage failed she could not bear to see him suffering to know him fancying himself neglected and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr knightleys that when once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she hesitated she could not proceed in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden illumination of mr woodhouse s mind or any wonderful change of his nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another way mrs weston s poultry house was robbed one night of all her turkeys evidently by the ingenuity of man other poultry yards in the neighbourhood also suffered pilfering was _ housebreaking _ to mr woodhouse s fears he was very uneasy and but for the sense of his son in law s protection would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life the strength resolution and presence of mind of the mr knightleys commanded his fullest dependence while either of them protected him and his hartfield was safe but mr john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november the result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment she was able to fix her wedding day and mr elton was called on within a month from the marriage of mr and mrs robert martin to join the hands of mr knightley and miss woodhouse the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have no taste for finery or parade and mrs elton from the particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very inferior to her own very little white satin very few lace veils a most pitiful business selina would stare when she heard of it but in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union

            "sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened elliot of kellynch hall walter elliot born march 1 1760 married july 15 1784 elizabeth daughter of james stevenson esq of south park in the county of gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue elizabeth born june 1 1785 anne born august 9 1787 a still born son november 5 1789 mary born november 20 1791 precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer s hands but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of himself and his family these words after the date of mary s birth married december 16 1810 charles son and heir of charles musgrove esq of uppercross in the county of somerset and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff representing a borough in three successive parliaments exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with the arms and motto principal seat kellynch hall in the county of somerset and sir walter s handwriting again in this finale heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson of the second sir walter vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot s character vanity of person and of situation he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at fifty four was still a very fine man few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own lady elliot had been an excellent woman sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwards she had humoured or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot s death and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower the other a widow that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman _ does _ marry again than when she does _ not _ but sir walter s continuing in singleness requires explanation be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing which he had not been very much tempted to do elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of her mother s rights and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together most happily his two other children were of very inferior value mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way she was only anne to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued god daughter favourite and friend lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore _ given _ all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow s foot about lady russell s temples had long been a distress to him elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot s death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the chapter ii mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter would rather have the _ disagreeable _ prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it much serious consideration she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour but she was as desirous of saving sir walter s feelings as solicitous for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them herself the widow of only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations and she did what nobody else thought of doing she consulted anne who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter every emendation of anne s had been on the side of honesty against importance she wanted more vigorous measures a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell looking over her paper much may be done if he will adopt these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families have done or ought to do there will be nothing singular in his case and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering as it always does of our conduct i have great hope of prevailing we must be serious and decided for after all the person who has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father there is still more due to the character of an honest man this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding his friends to be urging him she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty she rated lady russell s influence highly and as to the severe degree of self denial which her own conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete than to half a reformation her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on through the whole list of lady russell s too gentle reductions how anne s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence lady russell s had no success at all could not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort of life knocked off journeys london servants horses table contractions and restrictions every where to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms quit kellynch hall the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter s retrenching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go was settled and the first outline of this important change made out there had been three alternatives london bath or another house in the country all anne s wishes had been for the latter a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russell s society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her ambition but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her and bath was to be her home sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell s spending some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne s known wishes it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter s feelings they must have been dreadful and with regard to anne s dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there after her mother s death and secondly from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must suit them all and as to her young friend s health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good anne had been too little from home too little seen her spirits were not high a larger society would improve them she wanted her to be more known the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning he was not only to quit his home but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude which stronger heads than sir walter s have found too much kellynch hall was to be let this however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house mr shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour that he would let it at all how quick come the reasons for approving what we like lady russell had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an unprosperous marriage to her father s house with the additional burden of two children she was a clever young woman who understood the art of pleasing the art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility from situation mrs clay was in lady russell s estimate a very unequal and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliot s reach was therefore an object of first rate importance chapter iii i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper that the present juncture is much in our favour this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore they will be all wanting a home could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants many a noble fortune has been made during the war if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying sir walter only nodded but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed sarcastically there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune said mrs clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clay s health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him here anne spoke the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow very true very true what miss anne says is very true was mr shepherd s rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughter s but sir walter s remark was soon afterwards the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds of objection to it first as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a man s youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man i have observed it all my life a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line one day last spring in town i was in company with two men striking instances of what i am talking of lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable looking personage you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top in the name of heaven who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near sir basil morley old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin what do you take his age to be sixty said i or perhaps sixty two forty replied sir basil forty and no more picture to yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin s age nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only _ their _ lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter s good will towards a naval officer as tenant had been gifted with foresight for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him that accidentally hearing it was just as he had foretold mr shepherd observed sir walter s concerns could not be kept a secret accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let and understanding his mr shepherd s connection with the owner he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant and who is admiral croft was sir walter s cold suspicious inquiry mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman s family and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed added he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale hearty well looking man a little weather beaten to be sure but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a ready furnished house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral s family which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant he was a married man and without children the very state to be wished for a house was never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady as where there were many children a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture in the world he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be continued he asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not hear the appeal i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer s man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed after waiting another moment you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne mr shepherd was all gratitude wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term _ gentleman _ i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter s estimate of the dues of a tenant it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing in the admiral s situation in life which was just high enough and not too high i have let my house to admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere _ mr _ a _ mr _ save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of explanation an admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said with a gentle sigh a few months more and _ he _ perhaps may be walking here chapter iv _ he _ was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire in the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkford he was at that time a remarkably fine young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste and feeling half the sum of attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in having them accepted a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one troubles soon arose sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away which she grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious youth killing dependence it must not be if by any fair interference of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother s love and mother s rights it would be prevented captain wentworth had no fortune he had been lucky in his profession but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing but he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still such confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil it only added a dangerous character to himself he was brilliant he was headstrong lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror she deprecated the connexion in every light such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat young and gentle as she was it might yet have been possible to withstand her father s ill will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it but it was not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it had she not imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up the belief of being prudent and self denying principally for _ his _ advantage was her chief consolation under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment he had left the country in consequence a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance but not with a few months ended anne s share of suffering from it her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory no second attachment the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society around them she had been solicited when about two and twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir walter s and of good character and appearance and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father s house and settled so permanently near herself but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne s being tempted by some man of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits they knew not each other s opinion either its constancy or its change on the one leading point of anne s conduct for the subject was never alluded to but anne at seven and twenty thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen she did not blame lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs without reference to the actual results of their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ and all that he had told her would follow had taken place he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy she had no reason to believe him married how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful confidence in futurity against that over anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence she had been forced into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning with all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworth s sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil she was assisted however by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell s motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft s really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his the brother only with whom he had been residing had received any information of their short lived engagement that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature s having heard of it from him the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness chapter v on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft s seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell s and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided the whole business at once each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality on the admiral s side as could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherd s assurances of his being known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right and mr shepherd s clerks were set to work without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the best looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be no harm in him reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country did not think that everything considered she wished to remain it would be most right and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others something occurred however to give her a different duty mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing that she should not have a day s health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath i cannot possibly do without anne was mary s reasoning and elizabeth s reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay this invitation of mary s removed all lady russell s difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs clay s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared \n"
